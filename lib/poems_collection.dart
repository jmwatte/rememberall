SONNET 1 SHAKESPEARE 
From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
    To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

SONNET 2 SHAKESPEARE 
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'
Proving his beauty by succession thine!
    This were to be new made when thou art old,
    And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.

SONNET 3 SHAKESPEARE 
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form another;
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
Of his self-love to stop posterity?
Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
    But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
    Die single and thine image dies with thee.

SONNET 4 SHAKESPEARE 
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?
Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,
And being frank she lends to those are free:
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
The bounteous largess given thee to give?
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
For having traffic with thyself alone,
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive:
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
    Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
    Which, used, lives th' executor to be.

SONNET 5 SHAKESPEARE 
Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
Will play the tyrants to the very same
And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
For never-resting time leads summer on
To hideous winter, and confounds him there;
Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,
Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
Then were not summer's distillation left,
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:
    But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,
    Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.


SONNET 6 SHAKESPEARE
Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.
That use is not forbidden usury,
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
That's for thyself to breed another thee,
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,
If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
Leaving thee living in posterity?
    Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
    To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.

SONNET 7 SHAKESPEARE
Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,
The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
From his low tract, and look another way:
    So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:
    Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.

SONNET 8 SHAKESPEARE
Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
By unions married, do offend thine ear,
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
Resembling sire and child and happy mother,
Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
    Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
    Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'

SONNET 9 SHAKESPEARE
Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,
That thou consum'st thyself in single life?
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;
The world will be thy widow and still weep
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
When every private widow well may keep
By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
And kept unused the user so destroys it.
    No love toward others in that bosom sits
    That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.

SONNET 10 SHAKESPEARE
For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,
Who for thyself art so unprovident.
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,
But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,
That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire,
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:
Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
    Make thee another self for love of me,
    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.

SONNET 11 SHAKESPEARE
As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,
Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;
Without this folly, age, and cold decay:
If all were minded so, the times should cease
And threescore year would make the world away.
Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
    She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.

SONNET 12 SHAKESPEARE
When I do count the clock that tells the time,
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
When I behold the violet past prime,
And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
Then of thy beauty do I question make,
That thou among the wastes of time must go,
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
And die as fast as they see others grow;
    And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
    Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.

SONNET 13 SHAKESPEARE
O! that you were your self; but, love you are
No longer yours, than you yourself here live:
Against this coming end you should prepare,
And your sweet semblance to some other give:
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Find no determination; then you were
Yourself again, after yourself's decease,
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
Which husbandry in honour might uphold,
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
    O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,
    You had a father: let your son say so.

SONNET 14 SHAKESPEARE
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;
And yet methinks I have astronomy,
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
Or say with princes if it shall go well
By oft predict that I in heaven find:
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
And constant stars in them I read such art
As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,
If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';
    Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
    'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'

SONNET 15 SHAKESPEARE
When I consider everything that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment,
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
When I perceive that men as plants increase,
Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
And wear their brave state out of memory;
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay
To change your day of youth to sullied night,
    And all in war with Time for love of you,
    As he takes from you, I engraft you new.

SONNET 16 SHAKESPEARE
But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
And fortify yourself in your decay
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
And many maiden gardens, yet unset,
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
So should the lines of life that life repair,
Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.
    To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,
    And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.

SONNET 17 SHAKESPEARE
Who will believe my verse in time to come,
If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.
If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
The age to come would say 'This poet lies;
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
So should my papers, yellow'd with their age,
Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,
And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
And stretched metre of an antique song:
    But were some child of yours alive that time,
    You should live twice,—in it, and in my rhyme.

SONNET 18 SHAKESPEARE
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

SONNET 19 SHAKESPEARE
Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
And burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
Him in thy course untainted do allow
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
    Yet do thy worst, old Time; despite thy wrong,
    My love shall in my verse ever live young.

SONNET 20 SHAKESPEARE
A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion:
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,
Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
And for a woman wert thou first created;
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,
And by addition me of thee defeated,
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
    But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,
    Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.

SONNET 21 SHAKESPEARE
So is it not with me as with that Muse,
Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
Making a couplement of proud compare.
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
O! let me, true in love, but truly write,
And then believe me, my love is as fair
As any mother's child, though not so bright
As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:
    Let them say more that like of hearsay well;
    I will not praise that purpose not to sell.

SONNET 22 SHAKESPEARE
My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
So long as youth and thou are of one date;
But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
Then look I death my days should expiate.
For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
How can I then be elder than thou art?
O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
    Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,
    Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.

SONNET 23 SHAKESPEARE
As an unperfect actor on the stage,
Who with his fear is put beside his part,
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might.
O! let my looks be then the eloquence
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
    O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:
    To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.

SONNET 24 SHAKESPEARE
Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
And perspective it is best painter's art.
For through the painter must you see his skill,
To find where your true image pictur'd lies,
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
    Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
    They draw but what they see, know not the heart.

SONNET 25 SHAKESPEARE
Let those who are in favour with their stars
Of public honour and proud titles boast,
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
And in themselves their pride lies buried,
For at a frown they in their glory die.
The painful warrior famoused for fight,
After a thousand victories once foil'd,
Is from the book of honour razed quite,
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:
    Then happy I, that love and am belov'd,
    Where I may not remove nor be remov'd.

SONNET 26 SHAKESPEARE
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,
To thee I send this written embassage,
To witness duty, not to show my wit:
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
But that I hope some good conceit of thine
In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
    Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.

SONNET 27 SHAKESPEARE
Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;
But then begins a journey in my head
To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
Looking on darkness which the blind do see:
Save that my soul's imaginary sight
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,
Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
    Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
    For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.

SONNET 28 SHAKESPEARE
How can I then return in happy plight,
That am debarre'd the benefit of rest?
When day's oppression is not eas'd by night,
But day by night and night by day oppress'd,
And each, though enemies to either's reign,
Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
The one by toil, the other to complain
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
I tell the day, to please him thou art bright,
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
    But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
    And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.

SONNET 29 SHAKESPEARE
When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
I all alone beweep my outcast state,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
And look upon myself, and curse my fate,
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,
Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
With what I most enjoy contented least;
Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
    For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
    That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

SONNET 30 SHAKESPEARE
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past,
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
Which I new pay as if not paid before.
    But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
    All losses are restor'd and sorrows end.

SONNET 31 SHAKESPEARE
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
Which I by lacking have supposed dead;
And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,
And all those friends which I thought buried.
How many a holy and obsequious tear
Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
As interest of the dead, which now appear
But things remov'd that hidden in thee lie!
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
That due of many now is thine alone:
    Their images I lov'd, I view in thee,
    And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.

SONNET 32 SHAKESPEARE
If thou survive my well-contented day,
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
Exceeded by the height of happier men.
O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
To march in ranks of better equipage:
    But since he died and poets better prove,
    Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.

SONNET 33 SHAKESPEARE
Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
With ugly rack on his celestial face,
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
With all triumphant splendour on my brow;
But out! alack! he was but one hour mine,
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
    Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
    Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.

SONNET 34 SHAKESPEARE
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
And make me travel forth without my cloak,
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
For no man well of such a salve can speak,
That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
    Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
    And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.

SONNET 35 SHAKESPEARE
No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done:
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
All men make faults, and even I in this,
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense;
Thy adverse party is thy advocate,
And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
Such civil war is in my love and hate,
    That I an accessary needs must be,
    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.

SONNET 36 SHAKESPEARE
Let me confess that we two must be twain,
Although our undivided loves are one:
So shall those blots that do with me remain,
Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
In our two loves there is but one respect,
Though in our lives a separable spite,
Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

SONNET 37 SHAKESPEARE
As a decrepit father takes delight
To see his active child do deeds of youth,
So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;
For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
Or any of these all, or all, or more,
Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
I make my love engrafted, to this store:
So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis'd,
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
That I in thy abundance am suffic'd,
And by a part of all thy glory live.
    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:
    This wish I have; then ten times happy me!

SONNET 38 SHAKESPEARE
How can my Muse want subject to invent,
While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
O! give thyself the thanks, if aught in me
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
When thou thyself dost give invention light?
Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
    If my slight Muse do please these curious days,
    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.

SONNET 39 SHAKESPEARE
O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,
When thou art all the better part of me?
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
Even for this, let us divided live,
And our dear love lose name of single one,
That by this separation I may give
That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.
O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,
    And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
    By praising him here who doth hence remain.

SONNET 40 SHAKESPEARE
Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all;
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.
Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest,
I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;
But yet be blam'd, if thou thyself deceivest
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
And yet, love knows it is a greater grief
To bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury.
    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
    Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.

SONNET 41 SHAKESPEARE
Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,
When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,
For still temptation follows where thou art.
Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail'd;
And when a woman woos, what woman's son
Will sourly leave her till he have prevail'd?
Ay me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,
Who lead thee in their riot even there
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:
    Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
    Thine by thy beauty being false to me.

SONNET 42 SHAKESPEARE
That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye:
Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her;
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
    But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;
    Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.

SONNET 43 SHAKESPEARE
When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,
For all the day they view things unrespected;
But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,
How would thy shadow's form form happy show
To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made
By looking on thee in the living day,
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
    All days are nights to see till I see thee,
    And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.

SONNET 44 SHAKESPEARE
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
Injurious distance should not stop my way;
For then despite of space I would be brought,
From limits far remote, where thou dost stay.
No matter then although my foot did stand
Upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee;
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
As soon as think the place where he would be.
But, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
But that so much of earth and water wrought,
I must attend time's leisure with my moan;
    Receiving nought by elements so slow
    But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.

SONNET 45 SHAKESPEARE
The other two, slight air, and purging fire
Are both with thee, wherever I abide;
The first my thought, the other my desire,
These present-absent with swift motion slide.
For when these quicker elements are gone
In tender embassy of love to thee,
My life, being made of four, with two alone
Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;
Until life's composition be recur'd
By those swift messengers return'd from thee,
Who even but now come back again, assur'd,
Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:
    This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,
    I send them back again, and straight grow sad.

SONNET 46 SHAKESPEARE
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,
How to divide the conquest of thy sight;
Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,
A closet never pierced with crystal eyes;
But the defendant doth that plea deny,
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
To side this title is impannelled
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;
And by their verdict is determined
The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:
    As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,
    And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.

SONNET 47 SHAKESPEARE
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
And each doth good turns now unto the other:
When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,
With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
So, either by thy picture or my love,
Thyself away, art present still with me;
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
And I am still with them, and they with thee;
    Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
    Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.

SONNET 48 SHAKESPEARE
How careful was I when I took my way,
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
That to my use it might unused stay
From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,
Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,
Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
Within the gentle closure of my breast,
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;
    And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
    For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.

SONNET 49 SHAKESPEARE
Against that time, if ever that time come,
When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
Call'd to that audit by advis'd respects;
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,
When love, converted from the thing it was,
Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
Against that time do I ensconce me here,
Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
And this my hand, against my self uprear,
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:
    To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
    Since why to love I can allege no cause.

SONNET 50 SHAKESPEARE
How heavy do I journey on the way,
When what I seek, my weary travel's end,
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'
The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
As if by some instinct the wretch did know
His rider lov'd not speed, being made from thee:
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
Which heavily he answers with a groan,
More sharp to me than spurring to his side;
    For that same groan doth put this in my mind,
    My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.

SONNET 51 SHAKESPEARE
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
From where thou art why should I haste me thence?
Till I return, of posting is no need.
O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,
When swift extremity can seem but slow?
Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,
In winged speed no motion shall I know,
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,
Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race,
But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade:
    'Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,
    Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.'

SONNET 52 SHAKESPEARE
So am I as the rich, whose blessed key,
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
The which he will not every hour survey,
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
Since, seldom coming in that long year set,
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
So is the time that keeps you as my chest,
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
To make some special instant special-blest,
By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.
    Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,
    Being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope.

SONNET 53 SHAKESPEARE
What is your substance, whereof are you made,
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
Since every one, hath every one, one shade,
And you but one, can every shadow lend.
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
Is poorly imitated after you;
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
The other as your bounty doth appear;
And you in every blessed shape we know.
    In all external grace you have some part,
    But you like none, none you, for constant heart.

SONNET 54 SHAKESPEARE
O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
As the perfumed tincture of the roses.
Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly
When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
But, for their virtue only is their show,
They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:
    And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
    When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.

SONNET 55 SHAKESPEARE
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time.
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
And broils root out the work of masonry,
Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn
The living record of your memory.
'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
Even in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom.
    So, till the judgement that yourself arise,
    You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.

SONNET 56 SHAKESPEARE
Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,
To-morrow sharpened in his former might:
So, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill
Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
To-morrow see again, and do not kill
The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.
Let this sad interim like the ocean be
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new
Come daily to the banks, that when they see
Return of love, more blest may be the view;
    Or call it winter, which being full of care,
    Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.

SONNET 57 SHAKESPEARE
Being your slave what should I do but tend,
Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
I have no precious time at all to spend;
Nor services to do, till you require.
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
When you have bid your servant once adieu;
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
Save, where you are, how happy you make those.
    So true a fool is love, that in your will,
    Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.

SONNET 58 SHAKESPEARE
That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,
Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!
O! let me suffer, being at your beck,
The imprison'd absence of your liberty;
And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,
Without accusing you of injury.
Be where you list, your charter is so strong
That you yourself may privilage your time
To what you will; to you it doth belong
Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.
    I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,
    Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.

SONNET 59 SHAKESPEARE
If there be nothing new, but that which is
Hath been before, how are our brains beguil'd,
Which labouring for invention bear amiss
The second burthen of a former child!
O! that record could with a backward look,
Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
Show me your image in some antique book,
Since mind at first in character was done!
That I might see what the old world could say
To this composed wonder of your frame;
Wh'r we are mended, or wh'r better they,
Or whether revolution be the same.
    O! sure I am the wits of former days,
    To subjects worse have given admiring praise.

SONNET 60 SHAKESPEARE
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
So do our minutes hasten to their end;
Each changing place with that which goes before,
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
Nativity, once in the main of light,
Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,
Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:
    And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand.
    Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.

SONNET 61 SHAKESPEARE
Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
So far from home into my deeds to pry,
To find out shames and idle hours in me,
The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?
O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
To play the watchman ever for thy sake:
    For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
    From me far off, with others all too near.

SONNET 62 SHAKESPEARE
Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
And all my soul, and all my every part;
And for this sin there is no remedy,
It is so grounded inward in my heart.
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
No shape so true, no truth of such account;
And for myself mine own worth do define,
As I all other in all worths surmount.
But when my glass shows me myself indeed
Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity,
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
Self so self-loving were iniquity.
    'Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,
    Painting my age with beauty of thy days.

SONNET 63 SHAKESPEARE
Against my love shall be as I am now,
With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn;
When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night;
And all those beauties whereof now he's king
Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
For such a time do I now fortify
Against confounding age's cruel knife,
That he shall never cut from memory
My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:
    His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
    And they shall live, and he in them still green.

SONNET 64 SHAKESPEARE
When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age;
When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz'd,
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
And the firm soil win of the watery main,
Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;
When I have seen such interchange of state,
Or state itself confounded, to decay;
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate:
That Time will come and take my love away.
    This thought is as a death which cannot choose
    But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.

SONNET 65 SHAKESPEARE
Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
Against the wrackful siege of battering days,
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?
O fearful meditation! where, alack,
Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
    O! none, unless this miracle have might,
    That in black ink my love may still shine bright.

SONNET 66 SHAKESPEARE
Tired with all these, for restful death I cry:
As to behold desert a beggar born,
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,
And strength by limping sway disabled
And art made tongue-tied by authority,
And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,
And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
And captive good attending captain ill:
    Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,
    Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.

SONNET 67 SHAKESPEARE
Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,
And with his presence grace impiety,
That sin by him advantage should achieve,
And lace itself with his society?
Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
And steel dead seeming of his living hue?
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?
For she hath no exchequer now but his,
And proud of many, lives upon his gains.
    O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had
    In days long since, before these last so bad.

SONNET 68 SHAKESPEARE
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
Before the golden tresses of the dead,
The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
To live a second life on second head;
Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
In him those holy antique hours are seen,
Without all ornament, itself and true,
Making no summer of another's green,
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
    And him as for a map doth Nature store,
    To show false Art what beauty was of yore.

SONNET 69 SHAKESPEARE
Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;
All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,
Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;
But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,
In other accents do this praise confound
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
They look into the beauty of thy mind,
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds;
Then churls their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
    But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
    The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.

SONNET 70 SHAKESPEARE
That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,
For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
The ornament of beauty is suspect,
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
So thou be good, slander doth but approve
Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,
    If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
    Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.

SONNET 71 SHAKESPEARE
No longer mourn for me when I am dead
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
Give warning to the world that I am fled
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
Nay, if you read this line, remember not
The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
If thinking on me then should make you woe.
O if, I say, you look upon this verse,
When I perhaps compounded am with clay,
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
But let your love even with my life decay;
    Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
    And mock you with me after I am gone.

SONNET 72 SHAKESPEARE
O! lest the world should task you to recite
What merit lived in me, that you should love
After my death, dear love, forget me quite,
For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
To do more for me than mine own desert,
And hang more praise upon deceased I
Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
O! lest your true love may seem false in this
That you for love speak well of me untrue,
My name be buried where my body is,
And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
    For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
    And so should you, to love things nothing worth.

SONNET 73 SHAKESPEARE
That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west;
Which by and by black night doth take away,
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.
    This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
    To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.

SONNET 74 SHAKESPEARE
But be contented: when that fell arrest
Without all bail shall carry me away,
My life hath in this line some interest,
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
When thou reviewest this, thou dost review
The very part was consecrate to thee:
The earth can have but earth, which is his due;
My spirit is thine, the better part of me:
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
The prey of worms, my body being dead;
The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
Too base of thee to be remembered.
    The worth of that is that which it contains,
    And that is this, and this with thee remains.

SONNET 75 SHAKESPEARE
So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;
Now counting best to be with you alone,
Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure:
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
And by and by clean starved for a look;
Possessing or pursuing no delight,
Save what is had, or must from you be took.
    Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
    Or gluttoning on all, or all away.

SONNET 76 SHAKESPEARE
Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
So far from variation or quick change?
Why with the time do I not glance aside
To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
Why write I still all one, ever the same,
And keep invention in a noted weed,
That every word doth almost tell my name,
Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
O! know sweet love I always write of you,
And you and love are still my argument;
So all my best is dressing old words new,
Spending again what is already spent:
    For as the sun is daily new and old,
    So is my love still telling what is told.

SONNET 77 SHAKESPEARE
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;
These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
Time's thievish progress to eternity.
Look! what thy memory cannot contain,
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
    These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
    Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.

SONNET 78 SHAKESPEARE
So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,
And found such fair assistance in my verse
As every alien pen hath got my use
And under thee their poesy disperse.
Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
Have added feathers to the learned's wing
And given grace a double majesty.
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:
In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;
    But thou art all my art, and dost advance
    As high as learning, my rude ignorance.

SONNET 79 SHAKESPEARE
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;
But now my gracious numbers are decay'd,
And my sick Muse doth give an other place.
I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.
He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,
And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.
    Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
    Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.

SONNET 80 SHAKESPEARE
O how I faint when I of you do write,
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame!
But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
My saucy bark, inferior far to his,
On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;
Or, being wrack'd, I am a worthless boat,
He of tall building, and of goodly pride:
    Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
    The worst was this: my love was my decay.

SONNET 81 SHAKESPEARE
Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;
From hence your memory death cannot take,
Although in me each part will be forgotten.
Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:
The earth can yield me but a common grave,
When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.
Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;
And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
When all the breathers of this world are dead;
    You still shall live, such virtue hath my pen,
    Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.

SONNET 82 SHAKESPEARE
I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
The dedicated words which writers use
Of their fair subject, blessing every book.
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;
And therefore art enforced to seek anew
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
And do so, love; yet when they have devis'd,
What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd
In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;
    And their gross painting might be better us'd
    Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abus'd.

SONNET 83 SHAKESPEARE
I never saw that you did painting need,
And therefore to your fair no painting set;
I found, or thought I found, you did exceed
That barren tender of a poet's debt:
And therefore have I slept in your report,
That you yourself, being extant, well might show
How far a modern quill doth come too short,
Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
This silence for my sin you did impute,
Which shall be most my glory being dumb;
For I impair not beauty being mute,
When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
    There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
    Than both your poets can in praise devise.

SONNET 84 SHAKESPEARE
Who is it that says most, which can say more,
Than this rich praise: that you alone are you,
In whose confine immured is the store
Which should example where your equal grew.
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
That to his subject lends not some small glory;
But he that writes of you, if he can tell
That you are you, so dignifies his story,
Let him but copy what in you is writ,
Not making worse what nature made so clear,
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
Making his style admired every where.
    You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
    Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.

SONNET 85 SHAKESPEARE
My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
While comments of your praise richly compil'd,
Reserve their character with golden quill,
And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.
I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,
And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'
To every hymn that able spirit affords,
In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'
And to the most of praise add something more;
But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
    Then others, for the breath of words respect,
    Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.

SONNET 86 SHAKESPEARE
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
Bound for the prize of all too precious you,
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
He, nor that affable familiar ghost
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
As victors of my silence cannot boast;
I was not sick of any fear from thence:
    But when your countenance fill'd up his line,
    Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.

SONNET 87 SHAKESPEARE
Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
My bonds in thee are all determinate.
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
And for that riches where is my deserving?
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
And so my patent back again is swerving.
Thyself thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
Comes home again, on better judgement making.
    Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,
    In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.

SONNET 88 SHAKESPEARE
When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,
And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight,
And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.
With mine own weakness, being best acquainted,
Upon thy part I can set down a story
Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted;
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:
And I by this will be a gainer too;
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
The injuries that to myself I do,
Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
    Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
    That for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.

SONNET 89 SHAKESPEARE
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
And I will comment upon that offence:
Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,
Against thy reasons making no defence.
Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill,
To set a form upon desired change,
As I'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,
I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;
Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,
And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
    For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
    For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.

SONNET 90 SHAKESPEARE
Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
And do not drop in for an after-loss:
Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow,
Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
To linger out a purpos'd overthrow.
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
When other petty griefs have done their spite,
But in the onset come: so shall I taste
At first the very worst of fortune's might;
    And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
    Compar'd with loss of thee, will not seem so.

SONNET 91 SHAKESPEARE
Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,
Some in their garments though new-fangled ill;
Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:
But these particulars are not my measure,
All these I better in one general best.
Thy love is better than high birth to me,
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,
Of more delight than hawks and horses be;
And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:
    Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take
    All this away, and me most wretched make.

SONNET 92 SHAKESPEARE
But do thy worst to steal thyself away,
For term of life thou art assured mine;
And life no longer than thy love will stay,
For it depends upon that love of thine.
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
When in the least of them my life hath end.
I see a better state to me belongs
Than that which on thy humour doth depend:
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
O! what a happy title do I find,
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
    But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
    Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.

SONNET 93 SHAKESPEARE
So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
Like a deceived husband; so love's face
May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;
Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:
For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.
In many's looks, the false heart's history
Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.
But heaven in thy creation did decree
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
    How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
    If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!

SONNET 94 SHAKESPEARE
They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
That do not do the thing they most do show,
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,
And husband nature's riches from expense;
They are the lords and owners of their faces,
Others, but stewards of their excellence.
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
Though to itself, it only live and die,
But if that flower with base infection meet,
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
    For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
    Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.

SONNET 95 SHAKESPEARE
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
O! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose.
That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
Making lascivious comments on thy sport,
Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;
Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
O! what a mansion have those vices got
Which for their habitation chose out thee,
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!
    Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;
    The hardest knife ill-us'd doth lose his edge.

SONNET 96 SHAKESPEARE
Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;
Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less:
Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.
As on the finger of a throned queen
The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,
So are those errors that in thee are seen
To truths translated, and for true things deem'd.
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
    But do not so; I love thee in such sort,
    As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

SONNET 97 SHAKESPEARE
How like a winter hath my absence been
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
What old December's bareness everywhere!
And yet this time removed was summer's time;
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
But hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit;
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
And, thou away, the very birds are mute:
    Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,
    That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.

SONNET 98 SHAKESPEARE
From you have I been absent in the spring,
When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim,
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,
That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
Could make me any summer's story tell,
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
    Yet seem'd it winter still, and you away,
    As with your shadow I with these did play.

SONNET 99 SHAKESPEARE
The forward violet thus did I chide:
Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd.
The lily I condemned for thy hand,
And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
One blushing shame, another white despair;
A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,
And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;
But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
    More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,
    But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.

SONNET 100 SHAKESPEARE
Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,
In gentle numbers time so idly spent;
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
If Time have any wrinkle graven there;
If any, be a satire to decay,
And make time's spoils despised every where.
    Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,
    So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.

SONNET 101 SHAKESPEARE
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd?
Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
So dost thou too, and therein dignified.
Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say,
'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;
Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;
But best is best, if never intermix'd'?
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
And to be prais'd of ages yet to be.
    Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how
    To make him seem long hence as he shows now.

SONNET 102 SHAKESPEARE
My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;
I love not less, though less the show appear;
That love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,
The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
When I was wont to greet it with my lays;
As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
Not that the summer is less pleasant now
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
But that wild music burthens every bough,
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
    Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
    Because I would not dull you with my song.

SONNET 103 SHAKESPEARE
Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,
That having such a scope to show her pride,
The argument, all bare, is of more worth
Than when it hath my added praise beside!
O! blame me not, if I no more can write!
Look in your glass, and there appears a face
That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,
To mar the subject that before was well?
For to no other pass my verses tend
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
    And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,
    Your own glass shows you when you look in it.

SONNET 104 SHAKESPEARE
To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
For as you were when first your eye I ey'd,
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,
In process of the seasons have I seen,
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd;
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd:
    For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:
    Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.

SONNET 105 SHAKESPEARE
Let not my love be call'd idolatry,
Nor my beloved as an idol show,
Since all alike my songs and praises be
To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
Still constant in a wondrous excellence;
Therefore my verse to constancy confin'd,
One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
'Fair, kind, and true,' is all my argument,
'Fair, kind, and true,' varying to other words;
And in this change is my invention spent,
Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
    Fair, kind, and true, have often liv'd alone,
    Which three till now, never kept seat in one.

SONNET 106 SHAKESPEARE
When in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
And beauty making beautiful old rime,
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
I see their antique pen would have express'd
Even such a beauty as you master now.
So all their praises are but prophecies
Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
And for they looked but with divining eyes,
They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
    For we, which now behold these present days,
    Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.

SONNET 107 SHAKESPEARE
Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
Can yet the lease of my true love control,
Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom.
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,
Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rime,
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:
    And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
    When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.

SONNET 108 SHAKESPEARE
What's in the brain, that ink may character,
Which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit?
What's new to speak, what now to register,
That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
I must each day say o'er the very same;
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.
So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
But makes antiquity for aye his page;
    Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
    Where time and outward form would show it dead.

SONNET 109 SHAKESPEARE
O! never say that I was false of heart,
Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify,
As easy might I from my self depart
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
That is my home of love: if I have rang'd,
Like him that travels, I return again;
Just to the time, not with the time exchang'd,
So that myself bring water for my stain.
Never believe though in my nature reign'd,
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
That it could so preposterously be stain'd,
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
    For nothing this wide universe I call,
    Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.

SONNET 110 SHAKESPEARE
Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
And made my self a motley to the view,
Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
Made old offences of affections new;
Most true it is, that I have look'd on truth
Askance and strangely; but, by all above,
These blenches gave my heart another youth,
And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.
Now all is done, save what shall have no end:
Mine appetite I never more will grind
On newer proof, to try an older friend,
A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.
    Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
    Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.

SONNET 111 SHAKESPEARE
O! for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
That did not better for my life provide
Than public means which public manners breeds.
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
And almost thence my nature is subdu'd
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
Pity me, then, and wish I were renew'd;
Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink,
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
No bitterness that I will bitter think,
Nor double penance, to correct correction.
    Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,
    Even that your pity is enough to cure me.

SONNET 112 SHAKESPEARE
Your love and pity doth the impression fill,
Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
For what care I who calls me well or ill,
So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
You are my all-the-world, and I must strive
To know my shames and praises from your tongue;
None else to me, nor I to none alive,
That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
In so profound abysm I throw all care
Of others' voices, that my adder's sense
To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
    You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
    That all the world besides methinks are dead.

SONNET 113 SHAKESPEARE
Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;
And that which governs me to go about
Doth part his function and is partly blind,
Seems seeing, but effectually is out;
For it no form delivers to the heart
Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch:
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch;
For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
The mountain or the sea, the day or night:
The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.
    Incapable of more, replete with you,
    My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.

SONNET 114 SHAKESPEARE
Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,
Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?
Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,
And that your love taught it this alchemy,
To make of monsters and things indigest
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
Creating every bad a perfect best,
As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
O! 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
    If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin
    That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.

SONNET 115 SHAKESPEARE
Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
Even those that said I could not love you dearer:
Yet then my judgement knew no reason why
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
But reckoning Time, whose million'd accidents
Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;
Alas! why fearing of Time's tyranny,
Might I not then say, 'Now I love you best,'
When I was certain o'er incertainty,
Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
    Love is a babe, then might I not say so,
    To give full growth to that which still doth grow?

SONNET 116 SHAKESPEARE
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:
O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is the star to every wandering bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come;
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
    If this be error and upon me prov'd,
    I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.

SONNET 117 SHAKESPEARE
Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all,
Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
And given to time your own dear-purchas'd right;
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
And on just proof surmise, accumulate;
Bring me within the level of your frown,
But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;
    Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
    The constancy and virtue of your love.

SONNET 118 SHAKESPEARE
Like as, to make our appetite more keen,
With eager compounds we our palate urge;
As, to prevent our maladies unseen,
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;
Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
To be diseas'd, ere that there was true needing.
Thus policy in love, to anticipate
The ills that were not, grew to faults assur'd,
And brought to medicine a healthful state
Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur'd;
    But thence I learn and find the lesson true,
    Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.

SONNET 119 SHAKESPEARE
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,
Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
Still losing when I saw myself to win!
What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted,
In the distraction of this madding fever!
O benefit of ill! now I find true
That better is, by evil still made better;
And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,
Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
    So I return rebuk'd to my content,
    And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.

SONNET 120 SHAKESPEARE
That you were once unkind befriends me now,
And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,
Needs must I under my transgression bow,
Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
For if you were by my unkindness shaken,
As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time;
And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime.
O! that our night of woe might have remember'd
My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd
The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!
    But that your trespass now becomes a fee;
    Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.

SONNET 121 SHAKESPEARE
'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,
When not to be receives reproach of being;
And the just pleasure lost, which is so deem'd
Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing:
For why should others' false adulterate eyes
Give salutation to my sportive blood?
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
No, I am that I am, and they that level
At my abuses reckon up their own:
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown;
    Unless this general evil they maintain,
    All men are bad and in their badness reign.

SONNET 122 SHAKESPEARE
Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
Full character'd with lasting memory,
Which shall above that idle rank remain,
Beyond all date; even to eternity:
Or, at the least, so long as brain and heart
Have faculty by nature to subsist;
Till each to raz'd oblivion yield his part
Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.
That poor retention could not so much hold,
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;
Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
To trust those tables that receive thee more:
    To keep an adjunct to remember thee
    Were to import forgetfulness in me.

SONNET 123 SHAKESPEARE
No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
Thy pyramids built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
They are but dressings of a former sight.
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
What thou dost foist upon us that is old;
And rather make them born to our desire
Than think that we before have heard them told.
Thy registers and thee I both defy,
Not wondering at the present nor the past,
For thy records and what we see doth lie,
Made more or less by thy continual haste.
    This I do vow and this shall ever be;
    I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.

SONNET 124 SHAKESPEARE
If my dear love were but the child of state,
It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd,
As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,
Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.
No, it was builded far from accident;
It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
Under the blow of thralled discontent,
Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:
It fears not policy, that heretic,
Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,
But all alone stands hugely politic,
That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.
    To this I witness call the fools of time,
    Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.

SONNET 125 SHAKESPEARE
Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,
With my extern the outward honouring,
Or laid great bases for eternity,
Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
Lose all and more by paying too much rent
For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
No; let me be obsequious in thy heart,
And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,
But mutual render, only me for thee.
    Hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul
    When most impeach'd, stands least in thy control.

SONNET 126 SHAKESPEARE
O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his fickle hour;
Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.
If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.
Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!
She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:
    Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
    And her quietus is to render thee.

SONNET 127 SHAKESPEARE
In the old age black was not counted fair,
Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;
But now is black beauty's successive heir,
And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:
For since each hand hath put on Nature's power,
Fairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face,
Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
But is profan'd, if not lives in disgrace.
Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
Sland'ring creation with a false esteem:
    Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,
    That every tongue says beauty should look so.

SONNET 128 SHAKESPEARE
How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!
To be so tickled, they would change their state
And situation with those dancing chips,
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
Making dead wood more bless'd than living lips.
    Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
    Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.

SONNET 129 SHAKESPEARE
The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Is lust in action: and till action, lust
Is perjur'd, murderous, bloody, full of blame,
Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;
Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight;
Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,
Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait,
On purpose laid to make the taker mad:
Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme;
A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;
Before, a joy propos'd; behind a dream.
    All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
    To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.

SONNET 130 SHAKESPEARE
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red, than her lips red:
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound:
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
    And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,
    As any she belied with false compare.

SONNET 131 SHAKESPEARE
Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold,
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
To say they err I dare not be so bold,
Although I swear it to myself alone.
And to be sure that is not false I swear,
A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,
One on another's neck, do witness bear
Thy black is fairest in my judgement's place.
    In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
    And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.

SONNET 132 SHAKESPEARE
Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black and loving mourners be,
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
Nor that full star that ushers in the even,
Doth half that glory to the sober west,
As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
O! let it then as well beseem thy heart
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,
And suit thy pity like in every part.
    Then will I swear beauty herself is black,
    And all they foul that thy complexion lack.

SONNET 133 SHAKESPEARE
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!
Is't not enough to torture me alone,
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:
Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken;
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross'd:
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail:
    And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,
    Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.

SONNET 134 SHAKESPEARE
So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,
And I my self am mortgag'd to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:
But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
For thou art covetous, and he is kind;
He learn'd but surety-like to write for me,
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
Thou usurer, that putt'st forth all to use,
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
    Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:
    He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.

SONNET 135 SHAKESPEARE
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'
And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus;
More than enough am I that vex'd thee still,
To thy sweet will making addition thus.
Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
Shall will in others seem right gracious,
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,
And in abundance addeth to his store;
So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'
One will of mine, to make thy large will more.
    Let no unkind 'No' fair beseechers kill;
    Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'

SONNET 136 SHAKESPEARE
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will',
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;
Thus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.
'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.
In things of great receipt with ease we prove
Among a number one is reckon'd none:
Then in the number let me pass untold,
Though in thy store's account I one must be;
For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold
That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:
    Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
    And then thou lov'st me for my name is 'Will.'

SONNET 137 SHAKESPEARE
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
That they behold, and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,
Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
Whereto the judgement of my heart is tied?
Why should my heart think that a several plot,
Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,
To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
    In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd,
    And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.

SONNET 138 SHAKESPEARE
When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
Although she knows my days are past the best,
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
And wherefore say not I that I am old?
O! love's best habit is in seeming trust,
And age in love, loves not to have years told:
    Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,
    And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.

SONNET 139 SHAKESPEARE
O! call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye, but with thy tongue:
Use power with power, and slay me not by art,
Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
What need'st thou wound with cunning, when thy might
Is more than my o'erpress'd defence can bide?
Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
    Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
    Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.


SONNET 140 SHAKESPEARE
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
If I might teach thee wit, better it were,
Though not to love, yet love to tell me so,
As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,
No news but health from their physicians know.
For, if I should despair, I should grow mad,
And in my madness might speak ill of thee;
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.
    That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
    Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.

SONNET 141 SHAKESPEARE
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote.
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted;
Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone:
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,
Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:
    Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
    That she that makes me sin awards me pain.

SONNET 142 SHAKESPEARE
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:
O! but with mine compare thou thine own state,
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,
That have profan'd their scarlet ornaments
And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,
Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lov'st those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
    If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
    By self-example mayst thou be denied!

SONNET 143 SHAKESPEARE
Lo, as a careful housewife runs to catch
One of her feather'd creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay;
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
To follow that which flies before her face,
Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;
But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,
And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind;
    So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'
    If thou turn back and my loud crying still.

SONNET 144 SHAKESPEARE
Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
The better angel is a man right fair,
The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
To win me soon to hell, my female evil,
Tempteth my better angel from my side,
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend,
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;
But being both from me, both to each friend,
I guess one angel in another's hell:
    Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
    Till my bad angel fire my good one out.

SONNET 145 SHAKESPEARE
Those lips that Love's own hand did make,
Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',
To me that languish'd for her sake:
But when she saw my woeful state,
Straight in her heart did mercy come,
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
Was us'd in giving gentle doom;
And taught it thus anew to greet;
'I hate' she alter'd with an end,
That followed it as gentle day,
Doth follow night, who like a fiend
From heaven to hell is flown away.
    'I hate', from hate away she threw,
    And sav'd my life, saying 'not you'.

SONNET 146 SHAKESPEARE
Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
My sinful earth these rebel powers array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
Within be fed, without be rich no more:
    So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
    And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.

SONNET 147 SHAKESPEARE
My love is as a fever longing still,
For that which longer nurseth the disease;
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
My reason, the physician to my love,
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
Desire is death, which physic did except.
Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
At random from the truth vainly express'd;
    For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

SONNET 148 SHAKESPEARE
O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight;
Or, if they have, where is my judgement fled,
That censures falsely what they see aright?
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
What means the world to say it is not so?
If it be not, then love doth well denote
Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
How can it? O! how can Love's eye be true,
That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.
    O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
    Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.

SONNET 149 SHAKESPEARE
Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee, when I forgot
Am of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake?
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,
On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,
Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend
Revenge upon myself with present moan?
What merit do I in my self respect,
That is so proud thy service to despise,
When all my best doth worship thy defect,
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
    But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;
    Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.

SONNET 150 SHAKESPEARE
O! from what power hast thou this powerful might,
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
That in the very refuse of thy deeds
There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
O! though I love what others do abhor,
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:
    If thy unworthiness rais'd love in me,
    More worthy I to be belov'd of thee.

SONNET 151 SHAKESPEARE
Love is too young to know what conscience is,
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
For, thou betraying me, I do betray
My nobler part to my gross body's treason;
My soul doth tell my body that he may
Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,
But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,
He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
    No want of conscience hold it that I call
    Her 'love,' for whose dear love I rise and fall.

SONNET 152 SHAKESPEARE
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,
In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
When I break twenty? I am perjur'd most;
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,
And all my honest faith in thee is lost:
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,
Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;
And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,
Or made them swear against the thing they see;
    For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured I,
    To swear against the truth so foul a lie.

SONNET 153 SHAKESPEARE
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love,
A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
    But found no cure, the bath for my help lies
    Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.

SONNET 154 SHAKESPEARE
The little Love-god lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
The fairest votary took up that fire
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
And so the general of hot desire
Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd.
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,
    Came there for cure and this by that I prove,
    Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.





        



THE ADDAMS FAMILY
	Ba da da doom
They're creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and spooky
They're all together ooky, the Addams Family
Their house is a museum, when people come to see-em
They really are a scre-um the Addams Family
	Ba da da doom
So get a witch's shawl on, a broomstick you can crawl on
We're going to make a call on the Addams Family

AFTERNOON DELIGHT
Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight, gonna grab some Afternoon Delight
My motto's always been "When it's right, it's right."
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?
	When everything's a little clearer in the light of day?
	And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway?
Thinkin 'bout you's workin' up my appetite, lookin' forward to a little Afternoon Delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbin' you is getting so exciting
	Skyrockets in flight! Afternoon Delight! Afternoon Delight! Afternoon Delight!
Started out this morning feeling so polite
I always thought a fish could not be caught that didn't bite.
But you got some bait a-waiting and I think I might like nibblin' a little Afternoon Delight
	Skyrockets in flight! Afternoon Delight! Afternoon Delight! Afternoon Delight!
     Be waiting for me, baby, when I come around.
     We can make a lot of loving 'fore the sun goes down
Thinkin' of you's workin' up my appetite, lookin' forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbin' you is getting so exciting
	Skyrockets in flight! Afternoon Delight!
	Afternoon Delight! Afternoon Delight! Afternoon Delight!

AFTER THE BALL
After the ball is over, after the break of  morn.
After the dancers' leaving, after the stars are gone.
Many a heart is aching, if you could read them all.
Many the hopes that have vanished, after the ball

AFTER YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT, YOU DON'T WANT-Irving Berlin
Listen to me, honey dear, something's wrong with you, I fear
It's getting harder to please you, harder and harder each year
I don't want to make you blue, but you need a talking to
Like a lot of people I know, here's what's wrong with you

After you get what you want, you don't want it
If I gave you the moon, you'd grow tired of it soon.
You're like a baby, you want what you want when you want it.
But after you are presented with what you want, you're discontented
You're always wishing and wanting for something
When you get what you want, you don't want what you get
And though I sit upon your knee, you'll grow tired of me,
'Cause after you get what you want, you don't want what you wanted at all.

Don't you say that I'm unkind, think it over and you'll find
You've got a changeable nature, you're always changing your mind
There's a longing in your eye, that is hard to satisfy
You're unhappy most of the time, here's the reason why

After you get what you want, you don't want it
If I gave you the moon, you'd grow tired of it soon.
And though I sit upon your knee, you'll grow tired of me,
'Cause after you get what you want, you don't want what you wanted at all.

AFTER YOU'VE GONE
	Now won't you listen, honey, while I say,
	"Howcould you tell me that you're going away?"
	Don't say that we must part. Don't break your baby's heart.
	You know I've loved you for these many years, loved you night and day
	Oh, honey, baby, won't you see my tears? Listen while I say......

After you've gone, and left me crying; After you've gone, there's no denying
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad, you'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had
There'll come a time, now don't forget it. There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Some day when you grow lonely, your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away.

After I'm gone, after we break up; after I'm gone, you're gonna wake up
You will find, you were blind to let somebody come and change your mind.
After the years we've been together, through joy and tears, all kinds of weather.
Some day, blue and down hearted, you'll long to be with me right back where you started
After I'm gone, after I'm gone away.

AGRICULTURAL IRISH GIRL
Now If all the women in the town were bundled up together
The girl I love could beat them all in any kind of weather
She doesn't wash the powder off because she doesn't wear it
Her face and figure are all her own, it's true for I declare
	That she's a fine big strong lump of an agricultural Irish girl
	She neither paints nor powders, and her figure is all her own
	But she can hit that hard ohh, you would think the kick of a mule you got
	The full of your arms of Irish love was Mary Ann Malone
Now she was only seventeen last Sat, and still inproving greatly
I wonder what she will be like when her bones are set completely
You'd think your hand was the moist, the moment that she takes it
And if there's any gin around, 'tis Mary Ann will takes it
	'Cos she's a fine big strong lump of agricultural Irish girl
	She neither paints nor powders, and her figure is all her own
	But she can hit that hard Ohh you would think the kick of a mule you got
	The full of your arms of Irish love is Mary Ann Malone
	Yes, the full of your arms of Irish love was Mary Ann Malone!

AIN'T MISBEHAVIN'
No one to talk with, all by myself, no one to walk with, but I'm happy on the shelf,
Ain't misbehavin' I'm savin' my love for you
I know for certain the one I love, I'm through with flirtin' it's just you I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin' I'm savin' my love for you
	Like Jack Horner in the corner, don't go nowhere, what do I care?
	Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me
I don't stay out late, don't care to go, I'm home about eight, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin' I'm savin' my love for you.

AIN'T SHE SWEET
Ain't  she sweet?  See her coming down the street.  Now I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?
Ain't she nice? Look her over once or twice. Now I ask you very confidentially, ain't she nice?
	Just cast an eye in her direction. Oh, me! Oh, my! Ain't that perfection?
I repeat, don't you think that's kind of neat? And I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?

AIN'T THAT A KICK IN THE HEAD
How lucky can one guy be? I kissed her and she kissed me
Like a fella once said "Ain't that a kick in the head?"
The room was completely black, I hugged her and she hugged back
Like a sailor said quote,  "Ain't that a hole in the boat?"
	My head keeps spinnin', I go to sleep and keep grinnin'
	If this is just the beginnin'...My life is gonna be.... beautiful
1. I've sunshine enough to spread, It's just like the fella said
"Tell me quick, ain't that a kick in the head?"       (repeat the song)
2.She's tellin' me we'll be wed..She's picked out a king sized bed
I couldn't feel any better or I'll be sick. Tell me quick...ain't that a kick
Tell me quick, ain't that a kick in the head. Tell me quick, ain't that a kick in the head.

AIN'T THAT A SHAME
You made me cry when you said, "Goodbye."
	Ain't that a shame, my tears fell like rain, ain't that a shame, you're the one to blame
You broke my heart, when you said we'll part.
	Ain't that a shame, my tears fell like rain, ain't that a shame, you're the one to blame
Farewell, goodbye, although I'll cry,
	Ain't that a shame, my tears fell like rain, ain't that a shame, you're the one to blame
You made me cry when you said, "Goodbye."
	Ain't that a shame, my tears fell like rain, ain't that a shame, you're the one to blame
Farewell, goodbye, although I'll cry,
	Ain't that a shame, my tears fell like rain, ain't that a shame, you're the one to blame

AIN'T TOO PROUD TO BEG
I know you wanna leave me, but I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy, I don't mind coz' you mean that much to me
	Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin', please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
	Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby, please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Now I heard a cryin' man, is half a man, with no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you, I don't mind weepin,' if it'll keep you by my side
	Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin', please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
	Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby, please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
If I have to sleep on your doorstep, all night and day, just to keep you from walkin' away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand, 'cause I want to keep you, any way I can
	Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin', please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
	Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby, please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Now I've gotta love so deep in the pit of my heart, and each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come and plead to you, baby, if pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out that door
	Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin', please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
	Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby, please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

AIN'T WE GOT FUN?
Every mornin', every evenin', ain't we got fun? Not much money, oh, but honey, ain't we got fun?
The rent's unpaid, dear, we haven't a car, but anyway, dear, we'll stay as we are.
Even if we owe the grocer, don't we have fun? Tax collector's getting closer, still we have fun.
There's nothing surer, the rich get rich and the poor get poorer.
In the meantime, in between time, ain't we got fun?

THE AIR THAT I BREATHE
If I could make a wish, I think I'd pass, can't think of anything I need.
No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound, nothing to eat, no books to read.
Making love with you has left me peaceful, warm and tired.
What more could I ask? There's nothing left to be desired.
Peace came upon me, and in peace we weep, so sleep, silent angel, go to sleep.
          Sometimes all I need is the air that I breathe and to love you.
          All I need is the air that I breathe, and to love you. All I need is the air that I breathe

ALBUQUERQUE IS A TURKEY
Albuquerque is a turkey, and he's feathered and he's fine,
Albuquerque is a turkey, and he's absolutely mine.
He's the best pet you can get yet, better than a dog or cat,
And he wobbles and he gobbles, and he's awfully proud of that.
Albuquerque is a turkey, and he's happy in his bed,
Because for Thanks...giving dinner, we eat egg foo yung instead!

AL DI LA
	La, la, la...........
Al di la means you are far above me, very far  (very far)
Al di la, as distant as the lovely evening star (evening star)
Where you walk, flowers bloom, when you smile, all the gloom turns to sunshine
And my heart opens wide, when you're gone, it fades inside and seems to have died

Al di la, I wondered as I drifted where you were
Al di la, the fog around me lifted, there you were
In the kiss that I gave was the love I had saved for a lifetime
Then I knew all of you was completely mine
	La, la, la, la, la........al di la!

ALL ALONE AM I
	All alone am I, ever since your good-bye, all alone with just a beat of my heart
	People all around, but I don't hear a sound, just the lonely beating of my heart
No use in holding other hands, for I'd be holding only emptiness
No use in kissing other lips, for I'd be thinking just of your caress
	All alone am I, ever since your good-bye, all alone with just a beat of my heart
	People all around, but I don't hear a sound, just the lonely beating of my heart
No other voice can say the words my heart must hear to ever sing again
The words you used to whisper low, no other love can ever bring again.
	All alone am I, ever since your good-bye, all alone with just a beat of my heart
	People all around, but I don't hear a sound, just the lonely beating of my heart

ALL BY MYSELF
	I'm so unhappy, what'll I do, I long for somebody who will sympathize with me
	I'm growing so tired of living alone, I lie awake all night and cry
	Nobody loves me, that's why.
All by myself, in the morning, all by myself in the night
I sit alone with a table and a chair, so unhappy there, playing solitaire
All by myself, I get lonely, watching the clock on the shelf
	I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
	I hate to grow older all by myself!
ALL DAY AND ALL OF THE NIGHT
I'm not content to be with you in the daytime. Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
The only time I feel alright is by your side. Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
	All day and all of the night, all day and all of the night, all day and all of the night
I believe that you and me last forever. Oh yeah, all day and nighttime yours, leave me never
The only time I feel alright is by your side. Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
	All day and all of the night, all day and all of the night
I believe that you and me last forever. Oh yeah, all day and nighttime yours, leave me never
The only time I feel alright is by your side. Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
	All day and all of the night, all day and all of the night, all day and all of the night

ALLEGHENY MOON
Allegheny Moon, I need your light to help me find romance tonight, so shine, shine, shine
Allegheny Moon, your silver beams can lead the way to golden dreams, so shine, shine, shine

High among the stars, so bright above, the magic of your lamp of love can make her mine
Allegheny Moon it's up to you, please see what you can do
For me and for my one and only love

High among the stars, so bright above, the magic of your lamp of love can make him mine
Allegheny Moon it's up to you, please see what you can do for me and for my one and only love
Shine on me tonight, Allegheny Moon

ALL I DO IS DREAM OF YOU
All I do is dream of you the whole night through. With the dawn I still go on and dream of you
You're every thought, you're everything, you're every song I ever sing
Summer, winter, autumn and spring.
And were there more than twenty-four hours a day, they'd be spent in sweet content, dreaming away.
	When skies are grey, when skies are blue, morning, noon and nighttime too,
	All I do the whole day through is dream of you.
All I do is dream of you the whole night through. With the dawn I still go on and dream of you
You're every thought, you're everything, you're every song I ever sing
All I do the whole day through is dream of you
All I do the whole day through is dream of you.

ALL I HAVE TO DO IS DREAM
Dreeeeeam, dream, dream, dream, dreeeeam, dream, dream, dream....
When I want you in my arms, when I want you and all your charms
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dreeeeam,  dream, dream, dream
When I feel blue in the night and I need you to hold me tight,
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dreeeeeeeeam
   	I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine anytime, night or day
Only trouble is gee whiz, I'm dreaming my life a-way
I need you so that I could die, I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dreeeeam  (Repeat last 4 lines)

ALL I NEED IS THE GIRL
Once my clothes were shabby, tailors called me Cabbie.
So I took a vow, said this bum'll be Beau Brummel
Now I'm smooth and snappy, now my tailor's happy
I'm the cat's meow, my wardrobe is a wow!
	Paris silk, Haris tweed
	There's only one thing I need
Got my tweed pressed, got my best vest, all I need now is the girl
Got my striped tie, got my hopes high
Got the time and the place and I got the rhythm,
Now all I need's the girl to go with'em
If she'll just appear we'll take this big town for a whirl
And if she'll say "My, darling, I'm yours"
I'll throw away my striped tie and my best-pressed tweed
All I really need is the girl

ALL IN LOVE IS FAIR
All is fair in love, love's a crazy game,
Two people vow to stay in love as one they say
But all is changed with time, the future none can see
The road you leave behind, ahead lies mystery
But all is fair in love, I had to go away
A writer takes his pen to write the words again, that all in love is fair

All of fate's a chance, it's either good or bad
I tossed my coin to say in love with me you'd stay
But all in war is so cold, you either win or lose
When all is put away, the losing side I'll play
But all is fair in love, I should have never left your side
A writer takes his pen
A writer takes his pen to write the words again, that all in love is fair  (X2)

ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS MY TWO FRONT TEETH
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth,  my two front teeth, my two front teeth.
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth, then I could wish you Merry Christmas.
 	It seems so long since I could say, "Sister Susie sitting on a thistle."
	Gosh, oh gee, how happy I'd be, if I could only whistle.
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth,  my two front teeth, my two front teeth.
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth, then I could wish you Merry Christmas.
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth, then I could wish you Merry Christmas.

ALL MY EXES LIVE IN TEXAS
	All my exes live in Texas, and Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
	But all my exes live in Texas, and that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee
Rosanna's down in Texarkana, wanted me to push her broom
Sweet Eileen's in Abilene, she forgot I hung the moon
And Allison's in Galveston, somehow lost her sanity
And Dimples, who now lives in Temple's, got the law looking for me
	All my exes live in Texas, and Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
	But all my exes live in Texas, and that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee
I remember that old Frio River, where I learned to swim
But it brings to mind another time, where I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation, I go there each night
But I always come back to myself, long before daylight
	All my exes live in Texas, and Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
	But all my exes live in Texas, and that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee
     Some folks think I'm hiding, it's been rumored that I died,
     But I'm alive and well in Tennessee

ALL MY LIFE'S A CIRCLE
	All my life's a circle,  sunrise and sundown;
	The moon rolls thru the nighttime till the daybreak comes around.
	All my life's a circle but I can't tell you why;
	The seasons spinning 'round again, the years keep rollin' by.
It seems like I've been here before, I can't remember when;
But I have this funny feeling that we'll all be together again.
There's no straight lines make up my life and all my roads have bends;
There's no clear-cut beginnings and so far no dead-ends.
	Chorus:
I found you a thousand times, I guess you done the same;
But then we lose each other, it's like a children's game;
As I find you here again a thought runs through my mind;
Our love is like a circle, let's go 'round one more time.
	Chorus

ALL MY LOVING
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you, tomorrow I'll miss you, remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away I'll write home every day, and I'll send all my loving to you
I'll pretend that I'm kissing the lips I am missing, and hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away I'll write home every day, and I'll send all my loving to you
	All my loving I will send to you
	All my loving, darling, I'll be true.

ALL OF ME
All of me, why not take all of me? Can't you see I'm no good without you?
Take my lips, I want to lose them. Take my arms, I'll never use them.
Your good-byes left me with eyes that cry. How can I go on without you?
You took the part that once was my heart, so why not take all of me?

ALL OF YOU
I love the look of you, the lure of you
The sweet of you, the pure of you
The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you
The east, west, north and the south of you

I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
So love, at least, a small percent of me, do
For I love all of you

ALL OR NOTHING AT ALL
All or nothing at all, half a love never appealed to me
If your heart never could yield to me, then I'd rather have nothing at all

All or nothing at all, if it's love, there is no in-between
Why begin, then cry for something that might have been
No, I'd rather have nothing at all
	But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
	Don't smile, or I'll be lost beyond recall
	The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
	And my heart may grow dizzy and fall
And if I fell under the spell of your call, I would be caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say "No, no," all or nothing at all

ALL OUT OF LOVE
I'm lyin' alone with my head on the phone, thinkin' of you 'til it hurts
I know you hurt too, but what else can we do, tor-mented and torn a-part.
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart, for times when my life seems so low.
It would make me believe what to-morrow could bring,
When to-day doesn't really know, doesn't really know.
	I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you, I know you were right, believin' for so long.
	I'm all out of love, what am I without you, I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong.
I want you to come back and carry me home, a-way from these long, lonely nights.
I'm reachin' for you. Are you feelin' it too? Does the feelin' seem oh, so right?
And what would you say if I called on you now, and said that I can't hold on?
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day, please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone.
	I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you, I know you were right, believin' for so long.
	I'm all out of love, what am I without you, I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong.
     Oooo....What are you thinking of, what are you thinking of
     What are you thinking of, what are you thinking of
	I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you, I know you were right, believin' for so long.
	I'm all out of love, what am I without you, I can't be too late, I know that I was so wrong.
    	I know that I was so wrong

ALL SHOOK UP
A-well-a bless my soul what's wrong with me, I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm acting queer as a bug, I'm in love, UH! I'm all shook up
Mm  mm  mm  mm  mm,  yeah yeah yeah
My hands are shaky and my knees are weak, I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck? I'm in love, UH! I'm all shook up
Mm  mm  mm  mm  mm,  yeah yeah yeah
	Please don't ask what's on my mind, I'm a little mixed up but I'm feeling fine
	When I'm near that girl that I love best, my heart beats so it scares me to death
When she touched my hand, what a chill I got, her kisses are like a volcano on top
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup, I'm in love, UH! I'm all shook up.
Mm mm mm mm mm,  yeah yeah yeah
Mm mm mm mm mm,  yeah yeah yeah
	My tongue gets tied when I try to speak, my insides shake like a leaf on a tree
	There's only one cure for this body of mine, that's to have that girl that I love so fine.
(When she touched my hand.....)

ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE
Time and again I've longed for adventure, something to make my heart beat the faster.
What did I long for? I never really knew.
Finding your love I've found my adventure, touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,
All that I want in all of this world is you.
	You are the promised kiss of springtime that makes the lonely winter seem long.
	You are the breathless hush of evening that trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
You are the angel glow that lights a star, the dearest things I know are what you are.
Some day my happy arms will hold you, and some day I'll know that moment divine,
When all the things you are, are mine!

ALL THE WAY
When somebody loves you, it's no good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you, when you need someone to cheer you all the way
	Taller than the tallest tree is, that's how it's go to feel
	Deeper than the deep blue sea is, that's how deep it  goes, if it's real
When somebody needs you, it's no good unless he needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years, and for all the in between years, come what may
	Who knows where the road will lead us, only a fool would say
	But if you let me love you, it's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way.

ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT
Sleep, my child, and peace attend thee, all through the night
Guardian angels God will send thee, all through the night
Soft, the drowsy hours are creeping, hill and dale, in slumber steeping
I my longing vigil keeping, all through the night

While the moon her watch is keeping, all through the night
While the weary world is sleeping, all through the night
O'er thy spirit gently stealing, visions of the light revealing
Breathes a pure and holy feeling, all through the night.

ALMOST LIKE BEING IN LOVE
What a day this has been, what a rare mood I'm in
Why it's almost like being in love
There's a smile on my face for the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
	All the music of life seems to be
	Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel when that bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling, I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love

ALONE
Alone, alone with a sky of romance above.
Alone, alone when you whisper, "Goodbye," my love.
But I will still remember the happiness we've known, and, though I may be alone, I'm not
Alone, as long as I find you in every dream,
I know I'll see you each night in the starlight gleam
And in those magin moments, I'll have you for my own.
Alone, till we are together, we two are alone.

ALONE AGAIN (NATURALLY)
In a little while from now, if I'm not feeling any less sour,
I promise myself to treat myself, and visit a nearby tower
	And, climbing to the top, will throw myself off
	In an effort to make it clear, to who-ever, what it's like when you're shattered,
	Left standing in the lurch, at a church where people saying
	My God, that's tough, she stood him up, no point in us remaining
	We may as well go home, as I did on my own, alone again, naturally
To think, that only yesterday I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, well, who wouldn't do, the role I was about to play
　　　　But, as if to knock me down, reality came around
	And, without so much as a mere touch, cut me into little pieces
		Leaving me to doubt talk about God, in his mercy
		Who, if He really does exist, why did he desert me
		And in my hour of need, I truly am indeed, alone again, naturally
	It seems to me that there are more hearts broken in the world
	That can't be mended, left unattended. What do we do? What do we do?
Now, looking back over the years, and whatever else that appears,
I remember I cried when my father died, never wishing to hid the tears
	And at sixty-five years old, my mother, God rest her soul
	Couldn't understand why the only man she had ever loved had been taken
		Leaving her to start, with a heart so badly broken
		Despite encouragement from me, no words were ever spoken
		And when she passed away, I cried and cried all day,
		Alone again, naturally, alone again, naturally

ALONE TOGETHER
Alone together, beyond the crowd, above the world, we're not too proud
To cling together, we're strong, as long as we're together
Alone together, the blinding rain, the starless night, were not in vain
For we're together and what is there to fear together
	Our love is as deep as the sea. Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can weather the great unknown, if we're alone together

ALREADY GONE
Well, I heard some people talkin' just the other day
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf
But let me tell you I got some news for you, and you'll soon find out it's true
And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself
	'Cause I'm already gone, and I'm feelin' strong
	I will sing this victory song, woo, hoo,hoo,woo,hoo,hoo
The letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right
Just remember this, my girl, when you look up in the sky
You can see the stars and still not see the light  (that's right)
	Yes, I'm already gone. Yes, I'm feelin' strong
	I will sing this victory song, woo, hoo,hoo,woo,hoo,hoo
Well I know it wasn't you who held me down
Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free
So often times it happens that we live our lives in chains
And we never even know we have the key
	But me, I'm already gone, and I'm feelin' strong
	I will sing this victory song, 'cause I'm already gone
	Yes, I'm already gone, and I'm feelin' strong
	I will sing this victory song, woo, hoo,hoo,woo,hoo,hoo

ALWAYS
I'll be loving you, always, with a love that's true, always
When the things you've planned need a helping hand
I will understand, always, always.

Days may not be fair, always. That's when I'll be there, always.
Not for just an hour, not for just a day
Not for just a year, but always.

ALWAYS AND FOREVER
Always and forever, each moment with you is just like a dream to met that somehow came true
And I know tomorrow will still be the same, 'cause we've got a life of love that won't ever change and
	Everyday, love me your own special way, melt all my heart away with a smile
	Take time to tell me, you really care, and we'll share tomorrow, together
	I'll always love you forever, forever
There'll always be sunshine when I look at you, it's something I can't explain just the things that you do
And if you get lonely, phone me and take a second to give to me that magic you make and
	Everyday, love me your own special way, melt all my heart away with a smile
	Take time to tell me, you really care, and we'll share tomorrow, together
	I'll always love you forever

ALWAYS ON MY MIND
Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could have
And maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should have
	If I made you feel second best, girl, I'm sorry, I was blind
	But you were always on my mind, you were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you, I'm so happy that you're mine
	Little things I should have said and done, I just never took the time
	You were always on my mind, you were always on my mind
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died,
Give me, give me one more chance to keep you satisfied, I'll keep you satisfied

ALWAYS TAKE A GIRL NAMED DAISY
Handsome Harry, Handsome Harry Thomas, he was sued, yes, sued for breach of promise
He took Mary walking through the dell, and said "Now don't you dare tell,
Mary went right home and told her mother, Ma told Pa and Pa then told her brother,
Brother told the preacher and the preacher went and tolled a wedding bell.	Never take a walk with 	Mary, never take a walk with Sue
	Never take a walk with Maud or Carrie, that's the kind of girl you'll have to marry
	If you take a girl out walking, down a little shady dell,
	Always take a girl named Daisy, 'cause daisies won't tell
Harry's married life was pure and simple till he met a girlie with a dimple
She said "Dear, I'm not acquainted here, I just came down from Beaver Fall
Harry winked and said, "Why, silk and satin, to this girl would be like Greek and Latin"
Harry felt like fainting when he missed his little dollar Ingersol.
	Never take a walk with Mary, never take a walk with Sue
	Never take a walk with Maud or Carrie, that's the kind of girl you'll have to marry
	If you take a girl out walking, down a little shady dell,
	Always take a girl named Daisy, 'cause daisies won't tell

AMAZING GRACE
Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now am found, was blind but now I see.
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,  and grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear The hour I first believed.
         repeat 1st verse

AMERICAN DREAM
I beg your pardon, mama, what did you say? My mind was drifting off on Martinique Bay.
It's not that I'm not interested, you see, Augusta, Georgia is just no place to be.
	I think Jamaican in the moonlight. Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night.
	We got no money, mama, but we can go. We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove.
Keep on talking, mama, I can hear your voice, it tickles down inside of my ear.
I feel a tropical vacation this year, might be the answer to this hillbilly fear.
	I think Jamaican in the moonlight. Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night.
	We got no money, mama, but we can go. We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove.
Voila! An American Dream. Well, we can travel, girl, without any means.
When it's as easy as closing your eyes, and dream Jamaica is a big neon sign.

Just keep talking, mama, I like that sound. It goes so easy with that rain falling down.
I think a tropical vacation this year, might be the answer to this hillbilly fear.

Voila! An American Dream. Well, we can travel, girl, without any means.
When it's as easy as closing your eyes, and dream Jamaica is a big neon sign.
	Just think Jamaican in the moonlight. Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night.
	We got no money, mama, but we can go. We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove.

AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL
Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain.
For purple mountain majesties, above the fruited plain.
America! America! God shed His grace on thee.
And crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea.

Oh, beautiful for patriot dream, that sees beyond the years.
Thine alabaster cities gleam, undimmed by human  tears.
America!  America!  God shed His grace on thee.
And crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea.
And crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea.

AMIE
I can see why you think you belong to me,
I never try to make you think, or let you see one thing for yourself,
But now you're off with someone else and I'm alone,
You see I thought that I might keep you for my own,
	Amie What you wanna do? I think I could stay with you, for a while, maybe longer if I do,
Don't you think the time is right for us to find,
All the things we thought weren't proper could be right in time and can you see,
Which way we should turn, together or alone,
I can never see what's right or what is wrong. Will it take to long to see,
	Amie What you wanna do? I think I could stay with you, for a while, maybe longer if I do,
Now it's come to what you want you've had your way,
All the things you thought before just faded into gray and can you see,
That I don't know if it's you or if it's me.  If it's one of us I'm sure we both will see,
Won't you look at me and tell me,
	Amie What you wanna do? I think I could stay with you, for a while, maybe longer if I do,
Falling in and out of love with you, falling in and out of love with you,
Don't know what I'm gonna do, I keep falling in and out of love with you

AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER
Our love affair is a wondrous thing, that we'll rejoice in remembering
Our love was born with our first embrace, and a page was torn out of time and space

Our love affair, may it always be a flame to burn through eternity
	So, take my hand with a fervent prayer
	That we may live, and we may share, a love affair to remember

AND I LOVE HER
I give her all my love, that's all I do.
And if you saw my love, you'd love her too, I love her.
She gives me everything, and tenderly.
The kiss my lover brings, she brings to me, and I love her.
	A love like ours could never die, as long as I have you near me.
Bright are the stars that shine, dark is the sky.
I know this love of mine will never die, I love her.

AND I LOVE YOU SO
And I love you so, the people ask me how, how I've lived till now, I tell them I don't know
I guess they understand how lonely life has been, but live began again the day you took my hand
	And, yes, I know how lonely life can be,
	The shadows follow me, and the night won't set me free
	But I don't let the evening bring me down, now that you're around me
And you love me too, your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free, I'm happy that you do
The book of life is brief, and once a page is read, all but love is dead, this is my belief
	And, yes, I know how loveless life can be
	The shadows follow me, and the night won't set me free
	But I don't let the evening bring me down, now that you're around me
And I love you so, the people ask me how, how I've lived till now, I tell them I don't know

ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW THEME SONG
Well, now, take down your fishin' pole, and meet me at the Fishin' Hole
We may not get a bite all day, but don't you rush away

What a great place to rest your bones, and mighty fine for skippin' stones
You'll feel fresh as a lemonade, a-settin' in the shade
	Whether it's hot, whether it's cool, oh, what a spot for whistlin' like a fool
What a fine day to take a stroll, and wander by the Fishin' Hole
I can't think of a better way to pass the time o' day

We'll have no need to call the roll, when we get to the Fishin' Hole
There'll be you, me, and Old Dog Trey, to doodle time away

If we don't hook a perch or bass, we'll cool our toes in dewy grass
Or else pull up a weed to chaw, and maybe set and jaw
	Hangin' around, takin' our ease, watchin' that hound a-scratchin' at his fleas
Come on, take down your fishin' pole, and meet me at the Fishin' Hole
I can't think of a better way to pass the time o' day

AND YOUR BIRD CAN SING
You tell me that you've got everything you want, and your bird can sing
But you don't get me, you don't get me

You say you've seen Seven Wonders, and your bird is green
But you can't see me, you can't see me
	When your prized possessions start to weigh you down
	Look in my direction, I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

	When your bird is broken, will it bring you down?
	You may be awoken, I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is, and your bird can swing
But you can't hear me, you can't hear me

ANGEL BABY
It's just like heaven being here with you, you're like an angel, too good to be true
But after all, I love you, I do, Angel Baby, my Angel Baby
When you are near me, my heart skips a beat, I can hardly stand on my own two feet
Because I love you, I love you, I do, Angel Baby, my Angel Baby
	Oh, I love you, oh I do, no one could love you like I do
    	Ooo................
Please, never leave me blue and alone, if you ever go, I'm sure you'll come back home
Because I love you, I love you, I do, Angel Baby, my Angel Baby
It's just like heaven being with you, dear, I could never stay away without you near
Because I love you, I love you, I do, Angel Baby, my Angel Baby
	Oh, I love you, oh I do, no one could love you like I do
    	Ooo................

ANGEL EYES
Try to think that love's not around, but it's uncomfortably near
This old heart ain't gaining no ground because my Angel Eyes ain't here.
Angel Eyes, that old devil sent, they glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent, misspent with Angel Eyes tonight
	So drink up, all you people, order anything you see
	Have fun, you happy people, the drink and the laugh's on me
Pardon me, but I gotta run, the fact's uncommonly clear
Gotta find who's now number one, and why my Angel Eyes ain't here;
Why my Angel Eyes ain't here; 'Scuse me while I disappear!

ANGEL OF THE MORNING
There'll be no strings to bind your hands, not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand, for it was I who chose to start
 I see no need to take me home. I'm old enough to face the dawn
	   Just call me angel of the morning, angel
	   Just touch my cheek before you leave me, b-by
	   Just call me angel of the morning, angel
	   Then slowly turn away from me
Maybe the sun's light will be dim, and it won't matter any-how
If morning's echo says we've sinned, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night, I won't be blinded by the light
	   Just call me angel of the morning, angel
	   Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
	   Just call me angel of the morning, angel
	   Then slowly turn away, I won't beg you to stay with me
	Through the tears, or the day, or the years, baby,
	   Just call me angel of the morning, angel
	   Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
	   Just call me angel of the morning, angel
	   Just touch my cheek before you leave me, darling  (repeat the last 2 lines, then fade)

ANNIE'S SONG
You fill up my senses,  like a night in a forest
Like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain
Like a storm in the desert,  like a sleepy blue ocean. You fill up my senses,  come fill me again

Come let me love you, let me give my life to you
Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms
Let me lay down beside you, let me always be with you
Come let me love you, come love me again, let me give my life to you
Come let me love you, come love me again

ANNIVERSARY SONG
Oh, how we danced on the night we were wed
We vowed our true love, though a word wasn't said.
The world was in bloom, there were stars in the skies
Except for the few that were there in your eyes
     Dear, as I held you so close in my arms, angels were singing a hymn to your charms
     Two hearts gently beating were murmuring low, "My darling, I love you so."
The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn
The sun shone anew, but the dance lingered on
Could we but relive that sweet moment sublime
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time
     Dear, as I held you so close in my arms........

AN OCCASIONAL MAN
I've got an island in the Pacific, and every thing about it is terrific
I've got the sun to tan me, palms to fan me, and an occasional man

I love my island, it's very lazy, if I should ever leave it I'd be crazy
I've got papayas, peaches, sandy beaches, and an occasional man
	When I go swimming, I am always dressed in style
	'Cause when I go swimming, I just wear a great big smile
My little island is made for pleasure, and in the cool of evening it's a treasure
And when the day grows later, what is greater than an occasional man

My little island is such a beauty, You may forget to heed the call of duty;
But if you give a slip to your ship, miss your trip, take a tip and blame -An occasional dame!

AN OLD FASHIONED LOVE SONG
	Just an old-fashioned love song, playin' on the radio
	And wrapped around the music is the sound of someone promising they'll never go
       You swear you've heard it before, as it slowly rambles on
       No need in bringing 'em back, 'cause they're never really gone
	Just an old-fashioned love song,  one I'm sure they wrote for you and me
	Just an old-fashioned love song, comin' down in three-part harmony
To weave our dreams upon and listen to each evening when the lights are low
To underscore our love affair with tenderness and feelings that we've come to know
      You swear you've heard it before, as it slowly rambles on and on
      No need in bringing 'em back, 'cause they're never really gone
	Just an old-fashioned love song, comin' down in three-part harmony
	Just an old-fashioned love song,  one I'm sure they wrote for you and me
To weave our dreams upon and listen to a song.....
	    Just an old song.....comin' down
	    Just an old song.....one I'm sure they wrote for you and me
	    Just an old-fashioned love song, comin' down in three-part harmony
	    Just an old-fashioned love song,  one I'm sure they wrote for you and me

ANOTHER SATURDAY NIGHT
	Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody, I got some money 'cause I just got paid
	How I wish I had someone to talk to, I'm in an awful way
I got in town a month ago, I seen a lotta girls since then
If I could meet 'em I could get 'em but as yet I haven't met 'em
That's why I'm in the shape I'm in
	Here's another Saturday night........................
Another fella told me he had a sister who looked just fine
Instead of being my deliverance, she had a strange resemblance to a cat named Frankenstein
	Here's another Saturday night........................
It's hard on a fella, when he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey to help me spend my money, I'm gonna have to blow this town
	Here's another Saturday night........................


ANOTHER SOMEBODY DONE SOMEBODY WRONG SONG
It's lonely out tonight, and the feelin' just got right for a brand new love song
Somebody done somebody wrong song
     Hey, won't ya play another somebody done somebody wrong song
     And make me feel at home, while I miss my baby, while I miss my baby
So please, play for me a sad melody, so sad that it makes everybody cry
A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong, 'cause I don't want to cry all alone
     Hey, won't ya play another somebody done somebody wrong song
     And make me feel at home, while I miss my baby, while I miss my baby
So please, play for me a sad melody, so sad that it makes everybody cry
A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong, 'cause I don't want to cry all alone
     Hey, won't ya play another somebody done somebody wrong song
     And make me feel at home, while I miss my baby, while I miss my baby

ANSWER ME,  MY LOVE
Answer me, oh, my love; Just what sin have I been guilty of?
Tell me how I came to lose your love, please answer me, sweet-heart.
You were mine yesterday; I believed that love was here to stay.
Won't you tell me where I've gone astray? Please answer me, my love.
	If you're happier with-out me, I'll try not to care;
	But if you still think a-bout  me, please listen to my prayer.
You must know I've been true; Won't you say that we can start anew?
In my sorrow, now I turn to you, please answer me,  my love.
In my sorrow, now I turn to you, please answer me,  my  love.

ANYTHING GOES
In olden days a glimpse of stocking was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows, anything goes
Good authors too who once knew better words now only use four letter words
Writing prose, anything goes
	The world has gone mad today and good's bad today
	And black's white today and day's night today
	When most guys today that women prize today are just silly gigolos
So though I'm not a great romancer, I know that you're bound to answer
When I propose, anything goes

ANY TIME
Any time you're feeling lonely, any time you're feeling blue,
Any time you feel downhearted, that will prove your love for me is true.
Any time you're thinking 'bout me, that's the time I'll be thinkin' of you
So any time you say you want me back again, that's the time I'll come back home to you.

ANY WAY YOU WANT ME
I'll be as strong as a mountain, or weak as a willow tree.
Any way you want me, well, that's how I will be.
I'll be as tame as a baby, or wild as the raging sea.
Any way you want me, well, that's how I will be.
	In your hands my heart is clay, to take and mold as you may
	I'm what you make me, you've only to take me, and in your arms I will stay
I'll be a fool or a wise man, my darling, you hold the key.
Yes, any way you want me, well, that's how I will be, I will  be

APRIL IN PARIS
April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom, holiday tables under the trees
April in Paris, this is a feeling no one can ever reprise
I never knew the charm of spring, never met it face to face
I never knew my heart could sing, never missed a warm embrace
Till April in Paris, whom can I run to? What have you done to my heart?

APRIL LOVE
April love is for the very young
Every star's a wishing star that shines for you
April love is all the seven wonders
One little kiss can tell you this is true

Sometimes an April day will suddenly bring showers
Rain to grow the flowers for her first bouquet
But April love can slip right through your fingers
So, if she's the one, don't let her run away

Sometimes an April day will suddenly bring showers
Rain to grow the flowers for her first bouquet
But April love can slip right through your fingers
So, if she's the one, don't let her run away
So, if she's the one, don't let her run away

APRIL SHOWERS
Though April showers may come your way, they bring the flowers that bloom in May
     So if it's raining, have no regrets, because it isn't raining rain, you know, it's raining violets
And when you see clouds upon the hills, you soon will see crowds of daffodils
     So keep on looking for a bluebird, and listening for his song, whenever April showers come along.

AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU'RE YOU
Every time you're near a rose, aren't you glad you've got a nose?
And, if the dawn is fresh with dew, aren't you glad you're you?

When a meadowlark appears, aren't you glad you've got two ears?
And, if your heart is singin' too, aren't you glad you're you?
	You can see a summer sky, or touch a friendly hand
	Or taste an apple pie, pardon the grammar, but ain't life grand?
And, when you wake up each morn', aren't you glad that you were born?
Think what you've got the whole day through, aren't you glad you're you?

ARE YOU HAVIN' ANY FUN
Hey, fella with a million smackers, and nervous indigestion,
Rich fella, eats milk and crackers, I'll ask you one question:
You silly so and so, with all your dough...

Are you havin' any fun? What ya getting' outa livin'?
What good is what you've got, if you're not havin' any fun?
Are you havin' any laughs? Are you gettin' any lovin?
If other people do, so can you, have a little fun
	After the honey's in the comb, little bees go out and play
	Even the old gray mare down home, has got to have hay...hey!
You better have some fun, you ain't gonna live forever
Before you're old and gray, still okay
Have your little fun, son, have your little fun!
	Why do you work and slave and save? Life is full of ifs and buts
	You know the squirrels save and save, and what have they got.....nuts!
Better have a little fun, you ain't gonna live forever
Before you're old and gray, still okay,
Have yourself some fun, son, have yourself a little fun!

ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT?
Are you lonesome tonight, do you miss me tonight? Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a bright summer day, when I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
	Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
	Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again? Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?

ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT?
Are you lonesome tonight, does your tummy feel tight?
Did you bring your Mylanta and Tums?
Does your memory stray to that bright sunny day
When you had all your teeth in your gums?
	Is your hairline receding, your eyes growing dim?
  	Hysterectomy for her, and it's prostate for him
Does your back give you pain, do your knees predict rain?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?

Is your blood pressure up, good cholesterol down?
Are you eating your low-fat cuisine?
All that oat-bran and fruit, Metamucil, to boot
Helps you run like a well-oiled machine.
	If it's football or baseball, he sure knows the score.
	Yes, he knows where it's at but forgets what it's for
So, your gallbladder's gone, but your gout lingers on
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?

When you're hungry, he's not, when you're cold, he is hot.
Then you start that old thermostat war.
When you turn out the light, he goes left, you go right.
Then you get his great symphonic snore.
	He was once so romantic, so witty and smart;
	How'd he turn out to be such a cranky old.....guy?
So, don't take any bets, it's as good as it gets
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?  (X2)

ARE YOU SINCERE
Are you sincere when you say, "I love you?" Are you sincere when you say, "I'll be true."
Do you mean every word that my ears have heard?
	I'd like to know which way to go, will our love grow, are you sincere?
Are you sincere when you say you miss me? Are you sincere every time you kiss me?
And are you really mine, every day, all the time.
	I'd like to know which way to go, will our love grow, are you sincere?

SINCERELY
Sincerely, oh, yes, sincerely, 'cause I love you so dearly, please say you'll be mine
Sincerely, oh, you know how I love  you, I'll do anything for you, please say you'll be mine
	Oh, Lord, won't you tell me why I love that girlie so,
	She doesn't want me, oh, I'll never, never, never, never let her go.
Sincerely, oh, you know how I love  you, I'll do anything for you, please say you'll be mine

ARE YOU SLEEPING
Are you sleeping? Can you hear me? Do you know if I am by your side?
Does it matter if you hear me? When the morning comes I'll be there by your side
	And in the morning when I wake up, she may be telling me goodbye, la la la la
	And in the evening if we break up, I'm wondering why, I'm wondering why
There was a time, we had a time, there was a time, we had a time
There was a time, there was a time when you were mine
We had a time, we had a time, we had a time, oh what a time
There was a time, there was a time when you were mine
	And in the evening if we go out, night time will find us at the show, la la la la
	Or we may decide to stay inside, you never know, you never know, etc.
Are you sleeping or can you hear me? Do you know if I am by your side?
Does it matter if you hear me? When the morning comes I'll be there by your side
Na, na, na...........(fade)

ARMED SERVICES MEDLEY
THE ARMY MARCHING SONG
Over hill, over dale, as we hit the dusty trail, and the Caissons Go Rolling Along
In and out, hear them shout, counter march and right about, and the Caissons Go Rolling Along.
	Then it's hi, hi, hee, in the field artillery, shout out your numbers loud and strong
	For where'er you go, you will always know that the Caissons Go Rolling Along.
First to fight for the right, and to build the Nation's might, and The Army Goes Rolling Along
Proud of all we have done, fighting till the battle's won, and The Army Goes Rolling Along
            Then it's hi! hi! hey! The Army's on its way. Count off the cadence, loud and strong
            For where'er we go, you will always know that The Army Goes Rolling Along!
MARINES' HYMN
From the Halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli
We fight our country's battles in the air, on land, and sea;
First to fight for right and freedom, and to keep our honor clean;
We are  proud to claim the title of United States Marine.
Yes, we're proud to claim the title of United States Marine.
ANCHORS AWEIGH
Stand Navy out to sea, fight our battle cry;
We'll never change our course, so vicious foe, steer shy-y-y,
	Roll out the T.  N.  T., Anchors Aweigh.
	Sail on to victory, and sink their bones to Davy Jones hooray!
Anchors aweigh, my boys, anchors aweigh,
Farewell to foreign shores, we sail at break of day-ay-ay
	Through our last night ashore, drink to the foam
	Until we meet once more, here's wishing you a happy voyage home!
OFF WE GO INTO THE WILD BLUE YONDER
Off we go, into the wild blue yonder, climbing high into the sun
Here they come, zooming to meet our thunder, at 'em boys, give 'er the gun
Down we dive, spouting our flame from under, off with one heckuva roar
We live in fame or go down in flame, hey, nothing'll stop the U.S. Air Force!

AROUND THE WORLD
Around the world I've searched for you.
I traveled on when hope was gone to keep our rendezvous

I knew somewhere, sometime, somehow,
You'd look at me and I would see the smile you're smiling now

It might have been in County Down,
Or in New York, in Gay Paree, or even London Town
No more will I go all around the world, for I have found my world in you

ARRIVEDERCI, ROMA
Arrivederci, Roma, goodbye, goodbye to Rome
City of a million moonlit faces, city of a million warm embraces
Where I found the one of all the faces, far from home

Arrivederci, Roma, it's time for us to part
Save the wedding bells for my returnin'
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearnin'
Please be sure the flame of love keeps burnin' in her heart

Arrivederci, Roma, goodbye, goodbye to Rome
City of a million moonlit faces, city of a million warm embraces
Where I found the one of all the faces, far from home
Where I found the one of all the faces, far from home

ARTHUR'S THEME
Once in your life you find her, someone who turns your heart around and
Next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with  you, even though you left her way across town
Wondering to yourself: "Hey, what've I found?"
	When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
	I know it's crazy, but it's true
	If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
	The best that you can do, the best that you can do, is fall in love
Arthur he does as he pleases.  All of his life, he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart, he's just... he's  just a boy
Living his life one day at a time, and showing himself a really good time, and
Laughing about the way  they want him to be
             REFRAIN  ("When you get caught.....")

AS LONG AS SHE NEEDS ME
As long as she/he needs me, I know where I must be
I'll cling on steadfastly, as long as she/he needs me

As long as life is long, I'll love her right or wrong
And, somehow, I'll be strong, as long as she/he needs me
	If you are lonely, then you will know
　　　　When someone needs you, you love them so
I won't betray that trust, though people say I must,
I've got to stay true, just as long as she/he needs me
　　　　When someone needs you, you love them so
I won't betray that trust, though people say I must,
I've got to stay true, just as long as she/he needs me

AS TEARS GO BY
It is the evening of the day. I sit and watch the children play
Smiling faces I can see,  but not for me, I sit and watch as tears go by
My riches can't buy everything. I want to hear the children sing
All I hear is the sound of rain falling on the ground. I sit and watch as tears go by
It is the evening of the day. I sit and watch the children play
Doing things I used to do, they think a-new. I sit and watch as tears go by

AS TIME GOES BY
You must remember this, a kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh;
The fundamental things apply, as time goes by.
And when two lovers woo, they still say I love you, on that you can re-ly;
No matter what the future brings, as time goes by
	Moonlight and love songs never out of date, hearts full of passion jealousy and hate,
	Woman needs man, and man must have his mate, that no one can deny.
It's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory, a case of do or die,
The world will always welcome lovers, as time goes  by.

AT LAST
At last my love has come a-long, my lonely days are over, and life is like a song.
At last the skies above are blue; my heart was wrapped in clover, the night I looked at you.
	I found a dream that I can speak to, a dream that I can call my own,
	I found a thrill to press my cheek to, a thrill I've never known.
You smiled, and then the spell was cast,
And here we are in heaven, for you are mine at last.

AT SEVENTEEN
I learned the truth at seventeen, that love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles, who married young and then retired

The valentines I never knew, the Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful, at seventeen I learned the truth
	And those of us with ravaged faces, lacking in the social graces
	Desperately remained at home, inventing lovers on the phone,
	Who called to say, "Come dance with me," and murmured vague obscenities
	It isn't all it seems, at seventeen
A brown-eyed girl in hand-me downs, whose name I never could pronounce
Said, "Pity please the ones who serve, they only get what they deserve"
The rich-relationed hometown queen marries into what she needs
A guarantee of company, and haven for the elderly
	Remember, those who win the game, lose the love they sought to gain,
	In debentures of quality, and dubious integrity
	Their small-town eyes will gape at you, in dull surprise, when payment due
	Exceeds accounts received, at seventeen
To those of us who knew the pain of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called, when choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago, and far away, the world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave, for free, to ugly duckling girls like me
	We play the game, and when we dare to cheat ourselves at solitaire,
	Inventing lovers on the phone, repenting other lives unknown
	That call and say, "Come dance with me," and murmur vague obscenities
	At ugly girls like me, at seventeen

AT SUNDOWN
Sunbeams are gently fading, slowly fading, the birds are waiting
To do their mating, when eventide is nigh
Moonbeams are descending, day is ending, a happy ending
The sun is sinking, below the western sky.

Every little  breeze is sighing of love undying at sundown
Every little bird is resting and feather-nesting at sundown
	Each little rosebud is sleeping, while shadows are creeping
In a little cottage cozy the world seems rosy at sundown
Where a loving smile will greet me and always meet me at sundown
	I seem to sigh, I'm in heaven, when night is falling and love  is calling me home.

AT THE CHOCOLATE BON BON BALL
At 12 o'clock last night I gently dimmed my light, then I fell into a slum-ber
I had a dream so rare, I know you'll declare, it was a marvelous wonder
Chocolate bon bons gave a ball for the candies one and all
	Dancing at the chocolate bon bon ball, prancing 'round that sugar-coated hall
	Adam with the black-jack in his hand, led the band
	Some young fellow called marshmallow played the mean and wicked cello
	Candy drops the world around us showered, when they opened up those almond bars
	And the Lollipop met Miss Lemon Drop at the Chocolate Bon Bon Ball
	La la la la  la  la  la    la    la
Those chocolate coated butts and those assorted nuts made love to Old Fashioned Taffy
A little jelly bean and Mr. Walnut Cream acted as though they were daffy
Fast asleep I'd love to fall, just to dream about that Ball
	Dancing at that Chocolate Bon Bon Ball, prancing round that sugar-coated hall
	Goodness how that licorated gum beat the drum
	Cupid's little peanut brittle played the jazz upon her fiddle
	When the break of day began to beat, old Rock Candy rocked them all to sleep
	Mrs. Juicy Fruit tore her Wrigley suit at the Chocolate Bon Bon Ball!
	La la la la  la  la  la    la    la
When the break of day began to beat, old Rock Candy rocked them all to sleep
Mrs. Juicy Fruit tore her Wrigley suit at the Chocolate Bon Bon Ball!
La la la la  la  la  la    la    la

AT THE HOP
Well, you can rock it, you can roll it, do the stomp, and even  stroll it, at the hop
When the record starts spinnin', you calypso when you chicken, at the hop
Do the dance sensation that is sweepin' the nation, at the hop
	Let's go to the hop, let's go to the hop, oh baby,
	Let's go to the hop, oh baby, let's go to the hop. Come on, let's go to the hop
Well, you can swing it, you can groove it, you can really start to move it, at the hop
Where the jockey is the smoothest, and the music is the coolest, at the hop
All the cats and chicks can get their kicks, at the hop

PALISADES PARK
Last night I took a walk after dark, a swingin' place called Palisades Park
To have some fun and see what I could see -That's where the girls are!
I took a ride on a shoot-the-chute, that girl I sat beside was awful cute
And when we stopped she was holdin' hands with me-My heart was flyin'
	Up like a rocket ship, down like a roller coaster
	Back like a loop-the-loop, and a-round like a merry-go-round
We ate at eight at a hot dog stand, we danced around to a rockin' band
And when I could, I gave that girl a hug-In the tunnel of love
You'll never know how great a kiss can feel, when you stop at the top of a Ferris wheel
When I fell in love-down at Palisades Park

DO YOU WANNA DANCE
Ah, ah, ah, ah,
Well, do you wanna dance under the moonlight, squeeze me all through the night
      Oh, baby, do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna dance, and hold my hand, tell me I'm your lovin' man
     Oh, baby, do you wanna dance?
	Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
	Do you do you do you do you wanna dance, oh, baby, do you  wanna dance
	Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
	Do you do you do you do you wanna dance, oh, baby, do you  wanna dance
Ah, ah, ah, ah, let's dance!

AULD LANG SYNE
Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot and days of auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear, for auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet, for auld lang syne.

AURA LEE
As the blackbird in the spring, 'neath the willow tree
Sat and piped I heard him sing, singing Aura Lee.
	Aura Lee, Aura Lee, maid of golden hair
	Sunshine came along with thee, and swallows in the air.
On her cheek the rose was born, and music when she spake
In her eyes the race of morn, with sudden splendor break.
	Aura Lee, Aura Lee, maid of golden hair
	Sunshine came along with thee, and swallows in the air.

AUTUMN LEAVES/LES FEUILLES MORTES
Oh! je voudrais tant que tu te souviennes, des jours heureux où nous étions amis
En ce temps-là la vie était plus belle, et le soleil plus brûlant qu'aujourdhui.
Les Feuilles Mortes se ramassent à la pelle, tu vois, je n'ai pas oublié
Les Feuilles Mortes se ramassent à la pelle, les souvenirs et les regrets aussi
Et le vent du Nord les emporte dans la nuit froide de l'oubli
Tu vois, je n'ai pas oublié la chanson que tu me chantais.

C'est une chanson qui nous ressemble, toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais.
Nous vivions tous les deux ensemble, toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais.
 	Mais la vie sépare ceux qui s'aiment, tout doucement sans  faire de bruit.
	Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants désunis.

The falling leaves drift by my window, the Autumn Leaves of  red and gold.
I see your lips, the summer kisses, the sunburned hands I used to hold.
	Since you went away the days grow long, and soon I'll hear old winter's song.
	But I miss you most of all, my darling, when Autumn Leaves start to fall.

AUTUMN TO MAY
Oh, once I had a little dog, his color it was brown
I taught him for to whistle, to sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long, his ears so very wide
Around the world in half a day, upon him I could ride.
	Sing, tarry all day, Sing, Autumn to May.
Oh, once I had a little frog, he wore a vest of red
He'd lean upon his silver cane, a top hat on his head
He'd speak of far off places, of things to see and do,
And all the Kings and Queens he'd met while sailing in a shoe.
	Sing, tarry all day, Sing, Autumn to May.
Oh, once I had a flock of sheep, they grazed upon a feather
I'd keep them in a music box from wind or rainy weather
And every day, the sun would shine, they'd fly all through the town
To bring me back some golden rings, candy by the pound.
	Sing, tarry all day, Sing, Autumn to May.
Oh, once I had a downy swan, she was so very frail
She sat upon an oyster shell, and hatched me out a snail
The snail had changed into a bird, the bird to butterfly
And he who tells a bigger tale would have to tell a lie.
	Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.

AVALON
Ev'ry morn' my memories stray across the sea where flying fishes play
And as the night is falling, I find myself recalling that blissful, all-enthralling day
	I found my love in Avalon, beside the bay
	I  left my love in Avalon, and sailed a way
	I dream of her and Avalon from dusk 'til dawn
	And so I think I'll travel on to Avalon
Just before I sailed away, she said the word I longed to hear her say
I tenderly caressed her, close to my heart I pressed her, upon that golden yesterday
       chorus

A YOU'RE ADORABLE
When Johnny Jones was serenading Mary, he sure could quote a lot of poetry
But he'd much rather tell 'er what he learned in his speller, when they both attended PS 33
  (A) you're adorable, (B) you're so beautiful, (C) you're a cutie full of charms
(D) you're a darling and (E) you're exciting, (F) you're a feather in my arms
(G) you look good to me, (H) you're so heavenly, (I) you're the one I idolize
(J) we're like Jack and Jill, (K) you're so kissable, (L) is the love light in your eyes
	M, N, O, P, I could go on all day. Q, R, S, T, alphabetically speaking, you're OK
(U) made my life complete, (V) means you're very sweet, W, X, Y, Z
It's fun to wander through the alphabet with you, to tell you what you mean to me.
It's fun to wander through the alphabet with you, to tell you what you mean to me.

BABY, DON'T GET HOOKED ON ME
Girl you're gettin' that look in your eyes, and it's starting to worry me.
I ain't ready for no family ties, nobody's gonna hurry me.
Just keep it friendly, girl, 'cause I don't want to leave,
Don't start clinging to me, girl, 'cause I can't breathe.
	Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me.  Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me.
	'Cause I'll just use you, then I'll set you free. Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me.
Girl, you're a hot-blooded woman-child, and it's warm where you're touching me.
But I can tell by your tremblin' smile, you're seein' way too much of me.
Girl, don't let your life get tangled up with mine,
'Cause I'll just leave you, I can't take no clingin' vine.
	Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me.  Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me.
	'Cause I'll just use you, then I'll set you free. Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me.
	Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me.  Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me.
	'Cause I'll just use you, then I'll set you free. Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me.

BABY FACE
Baby Face, you've got the cutest little Baby Face, there's not another one could
Take your place, Baby Face,
My poor heart is jumpin; you sure have started somethin'
Baby Face; I'm up in heaven when I'm in your fond embrace,
I didn't need a shove 'Cause I just fell in love with your pretty Baby Face.

BABY, I'M-A WANT YOU
Baby, I'm-a want you, baby, I'm-a need you
You're the only one I care enough to hurt about
Maybe I'm-a crazy, but I just can't live without
Your lovin' and affection, givin' me direction
Like a guiding light to help me through my darkest hour
Lately I'm a-prayin' that you'll always be a-stayin' beside me
	Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
	Feeling all the while and never really knowing why
Lately I'm a-prayin' that you'll always be a-stayin' beside me
	Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
	Then you came along and made me laugh and made me cry, you taught me why
Baby, I'm-a want you, baby, I'm-a need you, oh, it took so long to find you, baby
Baby, I'm-a want you, baby, I'm-a need you

BABY, I'M YOURS
Baby, I'm yours, and I'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky
Yours until the rivers all run dry, in other words, until I die

Baby, I'm yours, and I'll be yours until the sun no longer shines
Yours until the poets run out of rhymes, in other words, until the end of time
　　　　I'm gonna stay right here by your side, do my best to keep you satisfied
 	Nothing in the world can drive me away, 'cause every day you'll hear me say
Baby, I'm yours, and I'll be yours until two and two is three
Yours until the mountain crumbles to the sea, in other words, until eternity
	Baby, I'm yours, 'til the stars fall from the sky,
　　　　Baby, I'm yours, 'til the rivers all run dry  (fade)

BABY, I NEED YOUR LOVIN'
     	Baby, I need your lovin', baby I need your lovin',
Although you're never near, your voice I often hear
Another day, an-other night, I long to hold you tight, 'cause I'm so lonely
	      Baby, I need your lovin', got to have all your lovin'
	      Baby, I need your lovin', got to have all your lovin'
Some say it's a sign of weakness  for a man to beg
Then weak I would rather be, if it means havin' you to keep, 'cause lately I've been losin' sleep
	    Every night I call your name. Sometimes I wonder, will I ever be the same.
When you see me smile, you know things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see,  has all been rehearsed
Darling, I can't go on without you,  this emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness in-side me, darlin', makes me feel  half alive.
	      Baby, I need your lovin', got to have all your lovin'
	      Baby, I need your lovin', got to have all your lovin'
	      Baby, I need your lovin'.

BABY, IT'S YOU
Sha la la la la la la la,  sha la la la la la la la,  sha la la la la la la la
 (sha la la la la) It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
 (sha la la la la) It's not the way you kiss that tears me a-part
	Oh, oh, many, many nights roll by, I sit alone at home and cry
	Over you, what can I do? I can't help my-self, cause, baby, it's you  (sha la la la la la la)
	Baby, it's you (sha la la la la la la)
 (sha la la la la ) You should hear what they say about you (cheat, cheat)
 (sha la la la la ) They say, they say you never, never, never been true (cheat, cheat)
	Oh, oh, it doesn't matter what they say, I know I'm gonna love you any old way
	What can I do, when it's true? I don't want no-body, nobody
	'Cause, baby, it's you (sha la la la la la la), baby, it's you (sha la la la la la)

BABY, NOW THAT I'VE FOUND YOU
	Baby, now that I've found you, I can't let you go
	I'll build my world around you, I need you so
	Baby, even though you don't need me, you don't need me  (repeat refrain)
Baby, baby, since first we met, I knew in this heart of mine (I wanna tell you..)
The love we had could not be bad, play it right, and bide my time

Spent a lifetime, looking for somebody to give me love like you
Now you've told me that you wanna leave me  (darling, I just can't let you)
      	(refrain)
Spent a lifetime, looking for somebody to give me love like you
Now you've told me that you wanna leave me  (darling, I just can't let you)
	Baby, now that I've found you, I can't let you go
	I'll build my world around you, I need you so
	Baby, even though you don't need me, you don't need me  (repeat refrain)

BABY'S IN BLACK
	Oh, dear, what can I do? Baby's in black, and I'm feelin' blue
	Tell me, oh, what can I do?
She thinks of him, and so, she dresses in black
And, though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black
	Oh, dear, what can I do? Baby's in black, and I'm feelin' blue
	Tell me, oh, what can I do?
I think of her, but she thinks only of him
And, though it's only a whim, she thinks of him
     Oh, how long will it take, 'til she sees the mistake she has made?
	Dear, what can I do? Baby's in black, and I'm feelin' blue
	Tell me, oh, what can I do?
     Oh, how long will it take, 'til she sees the mistake she has made?
	Dear, what can I do? Baby's in black, and I'm feelin' blue
	Tell me, oh, what can I do?
She thinks of him, and so, she dresses in black
And, though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black
	Oh, dear, what can I do? Baby's in black, and I'm feelin' blue
	Tell me, oh, what can I do?

BABY, YOU'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES
Well now it takes more than a robin to make the winter go
And it takes two lips for fire to melt away the snow
Well it takes two hearts that are cookin' to make a fire grow
And baby you've got what it takes

You know it takes alot of kissin' to make a romance sweet
Oh it takes a lot of lovin' to make my life complete
Oh well it takes somebody special to knock me off my feet
And baby you've got what it takes
	I said ooooooooooooooo.....Aha ooooooooooooooo.
	You know you've got just what it takes
Because it takes more effort to stay away from you
And it takes more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true
But it takes somebody special to make me say I do
And baby you've got what it takes

BACK HOME AGAIN
There's a storm across the valley, clouds are rolling in,
the afternoon is heavy on your shoulders.
There's a truck out on the four lane, a mile or more away,
the whining of his wheels just makes it colder.

He's an hour away from riding on your prayers up in the sky
and ten days on the road are barely gone.
There's a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove,
but it's the light in your eyes that makes him warm.
	Hey, it's good to be back home again.
	Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend.
	Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again.
There's all the news to tell him, how's you spend your time,
and what's the latest thing the neighbors say?
And your mother called last Friday, "Sunshine" made her cry
and you felt the baby move just yesterday.
	Hey, it's good to be back home again.
	Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend.
	Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again.
		Oh, the time that I can lay this tired old body down,
		and feel your fingers feather soft upon me.
		The kisses that I live for, the love that lights my way,
		the happiness that living with you brings me.
It's the sweetest thing I know of, just spending time with you.
It's the little things that make a house a home.
Like a fire softly burning and supper on the stove,
the light in your eyes that makes me warm.
	Hey, it's good to be back home again.
	Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend.
	Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again.

	Hey, it's good to be back home again.
	Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend.
	Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again.
	I said hey, it's good to be back home again.

BACK HOME AGAIN IN INDIANA
Back home again in Indiana and it seems that I can see
The gleaming candlelight still shining bright through the sycamores for me
The new mown hay sends all its fragrance from the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash, then I long for my Indiana home
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash, then I long for my Indi-ana home

BACK IN MY ARMS AGAIN
All day long I hear my telephone ring, friends calling giving their advice
From the girl/boy I love I should break away, 'cause heartaches she'll/he'll bring one day
     I lost her/him once through friends' advice, but it's not gonna happen twice
     'Cause all advice has ever gotten me, was many long and sleepless nights. Ooh!
	But now she's/he's back in my arms again, right by my side
	I've got her/him back in my arms again, so satisfied. Ooh!
It's easy for friends to say let her/him go, but I'm the one who needs her/him so
It's her/his love that makes me strong, without her/him I can't go on
     This time I'll live my life at ease, being happy lovin' whom I please
     And each time we make romance, I'll be thankful for a second chance. Ooh!
	'Cause she's/he's back in my arms again, right by my side
	I've got her/him back in my arms again, so satisfied. Ooh!
How can Gary/Mary tell me what to do, when he/she lost his/her love so true?
And Joe/Flo, he/she don't know 'cause the girl/boy he/she loves doesn't love him so/is a Romeo
     I listened once to my friends' advice, but it's not gonna happen twice
     'Cause all advice has ever gotten me was many long and sleepless nights. Ooh!
	I've got her/him back in my arms again, right by my side
	I've got her/him back in my arms again, so satisfied. Ooh!
            I'm satisfied, yeah so satisfied, I'm satisfied, I'm satisfied

BACK IN THE SADDLE AGAIN
I'm back in the saddle again, out where a friend is a friend
Where the longhorn cattle feed on the lowly jimson weed, I'm back in the saddle again.
I'm riding the range once more, totin' my old forty-four
Where you sleep every night and the only law is right, I'm back in the saddle again.
Whoopi ti-yi-yo, rocking to and fro, back in the saddle again
Whoopi ti-yi-yay, I go my way, back in the saddle again.

BACK IN YOUR OWN BACK YARD
	We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,
	Hoping every cloud will be silver lined.
	But we all return, as we live we learn,
	That we left our happiness behind.
The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you, back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane, back in your own back yard.
Oh, you can go to the East, go to the West,
But someday you'll come, weary at heart, back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes, back in your own backyard.
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes, back in your own backyard.

BAD MOON RISING
I see the bad moon a-risin'. I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'. I see bad times today
	Don't go around tonight, well, it's bound to take your life
	There's a bad moon on the rise
I hear hurricanes a-blowin'. I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers overflowin'. I hear the voice of rage and ruin
	Don't go around tonight, well, it's bound to take your life
	There's a bad moon on the rise
Hope you got your things together. Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather. One eye is taken for an eye
	Don't go around tonight, well, it's bound to take your life
	There's a bad moon on the rise  (repeat last 2 lines)

BALLAD OF DAVY CROCKETT
Born on a mountain top in Tennessee, greenest state in the land of the free
Raised in the woods so he knew every tree,  kilt him a bar when he was only three
	Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier! X2
Up through the woods he's a-marchin' along, makin' up yarns an' singin' a song
Itchin' for a fightin', and a-rightin' a wrong, grizzly as a bear and twice as strong.
	Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier! X2
His land is biggest an' his land is best, from grassy plains to the mountain crest
He's ahead of us all meetin' the test, followin' his legend into the West
	Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier! X2

BALLAD OF JED CLAMPETT
Come and listen to my story about a man named Jed,
A poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed,
Then one day he was shootin' at some food,
And up through the ground come a bubblin' crude.
	Oil that is, black gold, Texas tea.
Well, the first thing you know, ol' Jed's a millionaire,
Kinfolk said, "Jed, move away from there"
They said, "Californy is the place you ought to be"
So they loaded up the truck, and they moved to Beverly.
	Hills, that is. Swimmin' pools, movie stars.
Now it's time to say good-bye to Jed and all his kin.
And they would like to thank you folks fer kindly droppin' in.
You're all invited back next week to this locality
To have a heapin' helpin' of their hospitality
	Beverly Hillbillies. That's what they call 'em now. Nice folks.
	Y'all come back now, y'hear?

BAREFOOT DAYS
I can remember how proud I used to be,
When my Dad and Mother, they bought new shoes for me
Now, that's the feeling you've all had, how new shoes could make you glad
But the time that you recall, was when you wore no shoes at all
   CHORUS:
	Barefoot days, when I was just a kid, those barefoot days, oh, boy, the things we did
	We'd go down to a shady nook with a bent pin for a hook
	We'd fish all day, fish all night, but the darned ol' fish refused to bite
	Then we'd slide down some old cellar door, we'd slide an' slide, till our pants got tore
	Then we'd have to go home, climb into bed, till mama came along with a needle and thread
	O boy, what joy, we had in barefoot days
I'd be so happy if I could only be back in my old hometown, and the days that used to be
Yes, that was where we'd roam all day, down by the brook we used to play
They're the times that I recall, when I wore no shoes at all
	CHORUS

BASIN STREET BLUES
Won't you come along with me (come along with me), down the Mississippi; (down the Missis-sippi)
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams, steam down the river down to New Orleans.
The band's there to meet us, (the band's there to meet us),
Old friends to greet  us, (old friends to greet  us)
Where all people like to meet,  heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street
     Basin Street  is the street  where the best folks always meet, down in New Orleans, land of dreams
     You'll never know how nice it seems, or just how much it really means.
     Glad to be, yes-siree, where welcome's free, dear to me, where I can lose my Basin Street Blues.
     Glad to be, yes-siree, where welcome's free, dear to me, where I can lose my Basin Street Blues.

BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS
In 1814 we took a little trip, along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip.
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans.

    Chorus: 	We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin.
		There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.
		We fired once more and they began to runnin' on
		Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
We looked down the river and we see'd the British come.
And there must have been a hundred of'em beatin' on the drum.
They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring.
We stood by our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.
	Chorus
Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
If we didn't fire our muskets 'til we looked 'em in the eye
We held our fire 'til we see'd their faces well.
Then we opened up with squirrel guns and really gave 'em ... well
	Chorus
Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go.
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.**

We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down.
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round.
We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind.
	Chorus
Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go.
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.**

BAUBLES, BANGLES AND BEADS
Baubles, bangles, hear how they jing, jinga-linga, baubles, bangles, bright shiny beads
Sparkles, spangles, your heart will sing, singa-linga, wearing baubles, bangles and beads
	You'll glitter and gleam so, make somebody dream so that
Some day he may buy you a ring, ringa-linga, I've heard that's where it leads
Wearin' baubles, bangles, and beads
	You'll glitter and gleam so, make somebody dream so that
Some day he may, he may buy you a ring, ringa-linga, I've heard that that's where it leads
Wearing baubles bangles and beads (X3)

BAY MIR BISTU SHEYN
Of all the girls I've known, and I've known some, until I first met you I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me
You're really swell, I have to admit you deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've wracked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bay mir bistu sheyn, please let me explain, bay mir bistu sheyn means that you're grand
Bay mir bistu sheyn, again I'll explain, it means you're the fairest in the land
	I could say "Bella, bella," even say "Wunderbar."
	Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
I've tried to explain, bay mir bistu sheyn, so kiss me and say you'll understand.

Bay mir bistu sheyn, bay mir hostu kheyn, bay mir bistu sheynster oyf der velt
Bay mir bistu git, bay mir hostu "it", bay mir bistu tayerer fun gelt.
Fil sheyne meydlekh hobn shoyn gevolt nemen mir, un fun zey ale oysgeklibn hob ikh nor dikh.
Bay mir bistu sheyn, again I'll explain, it means you're the fairest in the land,

BEACH BOYS MEDLEY   
   CALIFORNIA GIRLS
Well, East Coast girls are hip, I really dig those styles they wear,
And the Southern girls with the way they talk, they knock me out when I'm down there.
The midwest farmers' daughters really make you feel alright,
And the Northern girls with the way they kiss, they keep their boyfriends warm at night.
I wish they all could be California, I wish they all could be California,
I wish they all could be California girls
   HELP ME, RHONDA
Since she put me down I've been out doin` in my head.

But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town.
When something comes up to me, he don't even try,
 'Cause if it had a set of wings, man, I know she could fly,
She's my little Deuce Coupe, you don't know what I got. (you don't know what I got)
She's my little Deuce Coupe, you don't know what I got.

I'm makin' real good bread, (get around, round, round I get a-round)
   Surfin` USA
If ev'rybody had an ocean, across the U.S.A., then everybody'd be surfin' like Californi-a.
You'd see them wearin' their baggies, huarachi sandals too,  
A bushy, bushy blond hairdo,  surfin' U.S.A.   
   FUN, FUN, FUN
Well, she got her daddy's car and she cruised through the hamburger stand, now.
Seems she for-got all about the library, like she told her old man, now.
And with the radio blastin' goes cruisin' just as fast as she can, now.
And she'll have fun, fun, fun, 'til her daddy takes the T-bird a-way.
And we'll have fun, fun, fun, playing ukulele both night and day.
And we'll have fun, fun, fun, playing ukulele both night and day.

BEAUTIFUL DREAMER
Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me, starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee.
Sounds of the rude world heard in the day, lulled by the moonlight have all passed away.
Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song, list' while I woo thee with soft melody.
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng,
	Beautiful dreamer awake unto me. Beautiful dreamer awake unto me.

Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea,  mermaids are chanting the wild Lorelei,
Over the streamlet vapors are borne, waiting to fade at the bright coming morn.
Beautiful dreamer, beam in my heart, e'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea,
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart,
	Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me, Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me.

BEAUTIFUL OHIO
Long, long ago, someone I know had a little red canoe, in it room for only two.
Love found its start, sang in my heart, and like a flower grew....
Drifting with the current down a moonlit stream
While above the Heavens in their glory gleam
And the stars on high twinkle in the sky.
Seeming in a Paradise of love divine
Dreaming of a pair of eyes that looked in mine.
Beautiful Ohio, in dreams again I see
Visions of what used to be....

BEAUTIFUL THAT WAY
Smile, without a reason why. Love, as if you were a child
Smile, no matter what they tell you. Don't listen to a word they say
'Cause life is beautiful that way.

Tears, a tidal wave of tears. Light, that slowly disappears
Wait, before you close the curtain. There is still another game to play
And life is beautiful that way

Here with his eyes forevermore, I will always be as close as you
remember from before
Now that you're out there on your own
Remember what is real and
what we dream is love alone

Keep the laughter in your eyes. Soon your long awaited prize
We'll forget about our sorrows, and think about a brighter day
'Cause life is beautiful that way.

We'll forget about our sorrows, and think about a brighter day,
Cause life is beautiful that way
There's still another game to play, and life is beautiful that way.

BECAUSE-Dave Clark Five
It's right that I should care about you, and try to make you happy when you're blue
It's right, it's right to feel the way I do, because, because  I love you
	It's wrong to say I don't think of you
	'Cause when you say these things, you know it makes me blue
Give me one kiss and I'll be happy, just, just to be with you
Give me, give me, a chance to be near you, because, because I love you

BECAUSE OF YOU
Because of you there's a song in my heart. Because of you my romance had its start
Because of you the sun will shine, the moon and stars will say you're mine
	Forever, and never to part
I only live for your love and your kiss. It's paradise to be near you like this
Because of you my life is now worthwhile, and I can smile, because of you

BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME
For all those times you stood by me, for all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life, for all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true, for all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful, baby. You're the one who held me up, never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all
	You were my strength when I was weak, you were my voice when I couldn't speak
	You were my eyes when I couldn't see, you saw the best there was in me
	Lifted me up when I couldn't reach, you gave me faith 'cause you believed
	I'm everything I am because you loved me
You gave me wings and made me fly, you touched my hand, I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me, you said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall, I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me. Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true- I was blessed because I was loved by you
	You were my strength when I was weak, you were my voice when I couldn't speak
	You were my eyes when I couldn't see, you saw the best there was in me
	Lifted me up when I couldn't reach, you gave me faith 'cause you believed
	I'm everything I am because you loved me
     You were always there for me, the tender wind that carried me
     A light in the dark shining your love into my life
     You've been my inspiration, through the lies you were the truth
     My world is a better place because of you
	You were my strength when I was weak, you were my voice when I couldn't speak
	You were my eyes when I couldn't see, you saw the best there was in me
	Lifted me up when I couldn't reach, you gave me faith 'cause you believed
	I'm everything I am because you loved me

	You were my strength when I was weak, you were my voice when I couldn't speak
	You were my eyes when I couldn't see, you saw the best there was in me
	Lifted me up when I couldn't reach, you gave me faith 'cause you believed
	I'm everything I am because you loved me
	I'm everything I am because you loved me

BEER BARREL POLKA
There's a garden, what a garden, only happy faces bloom there
And there's never any room there for a worry or a gloom there
Oh, there's music, and there's dancing, and a lot of sweet romancing
When they play the polka, they all get in the swing
	Every time they hear that oom pah pah, everybody feels so tra-la-la
	They want to throw their cares away, they all go la-de-ah-de-ay
	Then they hear a rumble on the floor, the floor, it's the big surprise they're waiting for
	And all the couples form a ring, for miles around you'll hear them sing
Roll out the barrel, we'll have a barrel of fun,
Roll out the barrel, we've got the blues on the run
Zing boom tararro, ring out a song of good cheer
Now's the time to roll the barrel, for the gang's all here

BEGIN THE BEGUINE
When they begin the beguine, it brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor, it brings back a memory ever green
I'm with you once more under the stars, and down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying, when they begin the beguine
	To live it again is past all endeavor, except when that tune clutches my heart
	And there we are, swearing to love forever, and promising never, never to part
What moments divine, what rapture serene,till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted, I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine, let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember, when they begin the beguine
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, "Darling, I love you"
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the beguine, when they begin the beguine

BE KIND TO YOUR PARENTS
Be kind to your parents, though they don't deserve it,
Remember they're grown-ups, a difficult stage of life
They're apt to be nervous, and over excited, confused from their daily storm and strife
	Just keep in mind, though it sounds odd, I know
	Most parents once were children long ago, Incredible!
So treat them with patience, and sweet understanding, in spite of the foolish things they do
Someday you may wake up, and find you're a parent too!

BE MY BABY
The night we met I knew I needed you so, and if I had the chance, I'd never let you go
So won't you say you love me, I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make 'em turn their heads every place we go
	So won't you, please, (Be my, be my baby) Be my little baby
	(My one and only baby) Say you'll be my darlin'
	(Be my, be my baby) Be my baby now, Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I'll make you happy, baby, just wait and see, for every kiss you give me, I'll give you three
Oh, since the day I saw you, I have been waiting for you
You know I will adore you 'til eternity
	So won't you, please, (Be my, be my baby) Be my little baby
	(My one and only baby) Say you'll be my darlin'
	(Be my, be my baby) Be my baby now, Whoa-oh-oh-oh
So, come on and please, (Be my, be my baby) Be my little baby
(My one and only baby) Say you'll be my darlin'
	(Be my, be my baby) Be my baby now, Whoa-oh-oh-oh

BE MY LIFE'S COMPANION
Be my life's companion and you'll never grow old,
I'll love you so much that you'll never grow old
When there's joy in living you just never grow old
You've got to stay young 'cause you'll never grow old
	People who are lonely can be old at thirty-three
	Don't let it happen to you, and don't let it happen to me
Be my life's companion and you'll never grow old
You'll never grow old, no, you'll never grow old
Love and youth and happiness are yours to have and hold
Be my life's companion and you'll never grow old
	I know a man who's lonely and he's old at thirty-three
	No one wants to be old at thirty-three
	Your-our-our disposition sours like a lemon on a tree
	Don't let it happen to you and don't let it happen to me
Be my life's companion and you'll never grow old
Yes I'll love you so much that you'll never grow old
Love and youth and happiness are yours to have and hold
Be my life's companion, be my life's companion, and you'll never grow old

BEND ME, SHAPE ME
You are all the woman I need, and baby you know it (know it, know it, know it)
You can make this beggar a king, a clown, or a poet (poet, poet, poet)
I'll give you all that I own, you've got me standing in line, out in the cold, pay me some mind
　　　　Bend me, shape me, any way you want me, long as you love me, it's alright
　　　　Bend me, shape me, any way you want me, you got the power to turn on the light
Everybody tells me I'm wrong to want you so badly (badly, badly, badly)
But there's a force driving me on, I follow it gladly (gladly, gladly, gladly)
So, let them laugh, I don't care, 'cause I got nothin' to hide, all that I want is you by my side
　　　　Bend me, shape me, any way you want me, long as you love me, it's alright
　　　　Bend me, shape me, any way you want me, you got the power to turn on the light
　　　　Bend me, shape me, any way you want me, long as you love me, it's alright
　　　　Bend me, shape me, any way you want me, you got the power to turn on the light

BE PREPARED
Be prepared! That's the Boy Scout's marching song,
Be prepared! As through life you march along.
Be prepared to hold your liquor pretty well,
Don't write naughty words on walls if you can't spell.
	Be pre-pared! To hide that pack of cigarettes,
	Don't make book if you cannot cover bets.
	Keep those reefers hidden where you're sure that they will not be found
	And be careful not to smoke them when the scoutmaster's around
	For he only will insist that they be shared.  Be prepared!
Be prepared! That's the Boy Scouts' solemn creed,
Be pre-pared! And be clean in word and deed.
Don't so-licit for your sister, that's not nice,
Unless you get a good percentage of her price.
	Be prepared! And be careful not to do
	Your good deeds when there's no one watching you.
	If you're looking for adventure of a new and different kind,
	And you come across a Girl Scout who is similarly inclined,
	Don't be nervous, don't be flustered, don't be scared.  Be prepared!

BESAME MUCHO
Besame, besame mucho, como si fuera esta noche la ultima vez
Besame, besame mucho, que tengo miedo perderte, perderte despues
Quiero tenerte muy cerca, mirar me en tus ojos, verte junto a mi
Piensa que tal vez ma-nana yo ya estare lejos, muy lejos de ti
Besame, besame mucho, como si fuera esta noche la ultima vez
Besame, besame mucho, que tengo miedo perderte, perderte despues

Besame, besame mucho, each time I cling to your kiss I hear music divine.
Besame mucho, hold me, my darling, and say that you'll always be mine.
This joy is something new, my arms enfolding you, never knew this thrill before
Whoever thought I'd be holding you close to me, whispering, "It's you I adore."
Dearest one, if you should leave me, each little dream would take wing and my life would be through
Besame, besame mucho, love me forever and make all my dreams come true.

THE BEST IS YET TO COME
Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along, and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet the best is yet to come

The best is yet to come, and, babe, won't it be fine
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
	Wait 'til the warmup's underway, wait 'til our lips have met
	Wait 'til you see that sunshine day, you ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine
The best is yet to come  (X3), come the day you're mine

THE BEST OF MY LOVE
Every night, I'm lying in bed, holding you close in my dreams
Thinking about all the things that we said, and coming apart at the seams
        We try to talk it over, but the words come out too rough
	I know you were trying to give me the best of your love
Beautiful faces  and loud empty places, look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine, left us so little to give
That same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud that we could never rise above
But here in my heart, I give you the best of my love
	Oh-oh-oh ohhhh, sweet darlin',  you get the best of my love
	Oh-oh-oh ohhhh, sweet darlin',  you get the best of my love
	 I'm going back in time and it's a sweet dream
	It was a quiet night and I would be all right if I could go on sleeping
But every morning I wake up and worry, what's gonna happen today?
You see it your way, and I see it mine, but we both see it slipping away
You know we always had each other baby, I guess that wasn't e-nough; o-o-ohh
But here in my heart, I give you the best of my love
	Oh-oh-oh ohhhh, sweet darlin',      you get the best of my love
	Oh-oh-oh ohhhh, sweet darlin',      you get the best of my love

THE BEST OF TIMES
The best of times is now, what's left of summer but a faded rose
The best of times is now, as for tomorrow well, who knows, who knows, who knows
So hold this moment fast, and live and love as hard as you know how
And make this moment last, because the best of times is now, is now, is now
	Now, not some forgotten yesterday
	Now, to-morrow is too far away
	So  hold this moment fast, and live and love as hard as you know how
	And make this moment last, because the best of times is now, is now, is now

THE BEST THINGS HAPPEN WHILE YOU'RE DANCING
The best things happen while you're dancing
Things you would not do at home come naturally on the floor
For dancing soon becomes romancing
When you hold a girl in your arms that you've never held before
	Even guys with two left feet come out alright if the girl is sweet
	If by chance their cheeks should meet while dancing
Proving that the best things happen while you dance

THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE
The moon belongs to everyone, the best things in life are free
The stars belong to everyone, they gleam there for you and me.
The flowers in Spring, the robins that sing
The sunbeams that shine, they're yours, they're mine!
And love can come to everyone, the best things in life are free
The best things in life are free.

BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP BLUE SEA
Is there anyone around who can not see it's the well-known runaround you're giving me
I suppose you'll tell me I'm all wrong.
It's a bitter pill to take, coming from you, though I've made a big mistake, what can I do?
I don't know what makes me string along.

I don't want you, but I'd hate to lose you,
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you, 'cause I can't forget you,
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
	I ought to cross you off my list, but when you come knocking at my door
	Fate seems to give my heart a twist, and I come running back for more
I should hate you, but I guess I love you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

BEWITCHED, BOTHERED AND BEWILDERED
She's a fool, and don't I know it, but a fool can have her charms
I'm in love, and don't I show it, like a babe in arms
Love's the same old sad sensation, lately I've not slept a wink
Since this silly situation has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again, a simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I
Couldn't sleep, and wouldn't sleep, when love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I
	Lost my heart, but what of it? She is cold, I agree
	She can laugh, but I love it, although the laugh's on me
I'll sing to her, each spring to her, and long for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched,  bothered and bewildered am I

BEYOND THE BLUE HORIZON
Beyond the Blue Horizon, waits a beautiful day
Goodbye to things that bore me, joy is waiting for me
I see the new horizon, my life has only begun
Beyond the Blue Horizon lies a rising sun

BEYOND THE SEA
Somewhere beyond the sea, somewhere waiting for me,
My lover stands on golden sands, and watches the ships that go sailing.
Somewhere beyond the sea, he's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high, then straight to his arms I'd go sailing.
It's far beyond a star, it's near beyond the moon.
I know beyond a doubt, my heart will lead me there soon.
We'll meet beyond the shore, we'll kiss just as before.
Happy we'll be beyond the sea and never again I'll go sailing.

BIDIN' MY TIME
     Some fellers like to tip-toe through the tulips, some fellers go on singin' in the rain
     Some fellers keep on paintin' skies with rainbows, some fellers go on swingin' down the lane
But I'm bidin' my time, 'cause that's the kind of guy I'm
While other folks grow dizzy, I'll keep busy, bidin' my time
Next year, next year, somethin's bound to happen.
This year, this year, I'll just keep on nappin'
And bidin' my time, 'cause that's the kind of guy I'm
There's no regrettin' when I'm a-settin,' bidin' my time

I'm bidin' my time, 'cause that's the kind of guy I'm
Beginnin' on a Monday, right through Sunday, bidin' my time
Give me, give me, glass that's full of twinkles
Let me, let me, dream like Rip Van Winkle.
He bided his time, and like that Winkle guyChasin' 'way flies, how the day flies, bidin' my time.

BIG BAD BILL IS SWEET WILLIAM NOW
In the town of Louisville they got a man they call Big Bad Bill
I want to tell you, he sure was tough, and he certainly did strut his stuff
He had folks all scared to death when he walked by they held their breath
He was a fightin' man, sure enough
Now Bill took himself a wife and he leads a different life
    'Cause Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now, married life has changed him somehow
    Well, he's the man they all used to fear but now the people call him Sweet Papa Willie dear
    Stronger than Samson, I declare, 'til the brown skinned mama bobbed his hair

    Big Bad Bill don't fight anymore, well, he washes dishes, and he mops up  the floor
    He used to spend his evenings lookin' for a fight, now he's  gotta see his mama every night
    	Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now
    Well, he used to spend his evenings lookin' for a fight, now he's  gotta see his mama every night
            Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now

BIG GIRLS DON'T CRY
	Big girls don't cry, big girls don't cry
Big girls don't cry (They don't cry), Big girls don't cry (Who said they don't cry?)
My girl said goodbye (My, oh my), My girl didn't cry (I wonder why)

(Silly boy) Told my girl we had to break up (Silly boy) Hoped that she would call my bluff
(Silly boy) When she said, to my surprise, "Big girls don't cry"
Big girls don't cry (They don't cry), Big girls don't cry (Who said they don't cry?)
 (Maybe) I was cruel (I was cruel) Baby, I'm a fool (I'm such a fool)

(Silly girl) Shame on you, your mama said (Silly girl) Shame on you, you're cryin' in bed
(Silly girl) Shame on you, you told a lie. Big girls do cry!
Big girls don't cry (They don't cry), Big girls don't cry (That's just an alibi)
	Big girls don't cry, big girls don't cry

BILL BAILEY, WON'T YOU PLEASE COME HOME
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home, she moans the whole day long.
I'll do the cooking, honey, I'll pay the rent, I know I've done you wrong.
'Member that rainy evening I drove you out, with nothin' but a fine tooth comb:?
I know I'm to blame, well, ain't that a shame? Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?

BIRD DOG
Johnny is a joker (he's a bird) a very funny joker (he's a bird)
But when he jokes my honey (he's a dog), his jokin' ain't so funny (what a dog)
Johnny is the joker who's tryin' to steal my baby (he's a bird dog!)

Johnny sings a love song (like a bird), he sings the sweetest love song (you ever heard)
But when he sings to my gal (what a howl), to me he's just a wolf dog (on the prowl)
Johnny wants to fly away and puppy-love my baby (he's a bird dog!)
	Hey, bird dog, get away from my quail; hey, bird dog, you're on the wrong trail.
	Bird dog, you'd better leave my lovey dove alone.
	Hey, bird dog, get away from my chick; hey, bird dog, you'd better get away quick.
	Bird dog, you'd better find a chicken little of your own.
Johnny kissed the teacher (he's a bird), he tiptoed up to reach her (what a bird)
He's the teacher's pet now (he's a dog), what he wants he can get now (what a dog)
He even made the teacher let him sit next to my baby (he's a bird dog!)
	Chorus ("Hey,bird dog....")

BIRD ON THE WIRE
Like a bird on the wire, like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm  on a hook, like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
	And if I, if I have been unkind, I hope that you can just let it go by.
       	And  if I, if I have been untrue, I hope you know it was never to you.
Like a baby, stillborn, like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song, and by all that I've done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.
	I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
	He said to me, "You must not ask for so much."
	And a pretty woman, leaning in her darkened door,
	She cried to me, "Hey, why not ask for more?"
Oh like a bird on the wire, Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.

BIRDS AND THE BEES
Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees, and the flowers and the trees,
And the moon up above, and a thing called love.
Let me tell ya 'bout the stars in the sky, and a girl and a guy,
And the way they could kiss, on a night like this
	When I look into your big brown eyes,  it's so very plain to see,
    	That it's time you learned about the facts of life,  starting from A to   Z.
Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees, and the flowers and the trees,
And the moon up above, and a thing called love,
And a thing called love, and a thing called love

BIRTH OF THE BLUES
They heard the breeze  in the trees  singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues
And from a jail came the wail of a down-hearted frail
And they played that as a part of the blues
From a whippoorwill, out on a hill, they took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn 'til it was worn into a blue note
And then they nursed it, and rehearsed it, and gave out the news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues.
They nursed it, rehearsed it, and gave out the news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues.

BLACKBIRD
Blackbird, singing in the dead of night, take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird, singing in the dead of night, take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to be free
	Blackbird fly, blackbird fly into the light of the dark black night
	Blackbird fly, blackbird fly into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird, singing in the dead of night, take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

BLAME IT ON THE BOSSA NOVA
I was at a dance when he caught my eye, standin' all alone lookin' sad and shy
We began to dance, swaying' to and fro, and soon I knew I'd never let him go
	Blame it on the bossa nova with its magic spell
	Blame it on the bossa nova that he did so well
	Oh, it all began with just one little dance, but then it ended up a big romance
	Blame it on the bossa nova, the dance of love
     (Now was it the moon?) No, no, the bossa nova, (Or the stars above?) No, no, the bossa nova
     (Now was it the tune?) Yeah, yeah, the bossa nova,        (The dance of love)
Now I'm glad to say I'm his bride to be, and we're gonna raise a family
And when our kids ask how it came about, I'm gonna say to them without a doubt
	(Blame it on the Bossa Nova...........)

BLAME IT ON THE SUN
Where has my love gone? How can I go on? It seems dear love has gone a-way.
Where is my spirit? I'm nowhere near it. Oh yes, my love has gone a-stray.
	But I'll blame it on the sun, the sun that didn't shine.
	I'll blame it on the wind and the trees.
	I'll blame it on the time, that never was enough.
	I'll blame it on the tide and sea.
	But, my heart blames it on me.
Who poured the love out? What made this bitter doubt? Is peace not here for me to see?
Wish I could tell you, what I am feeling. But, words won't come for me to speak.
	Oh, but I'll blame it on the sun, that didn't fill the sky
	I'll blame it on the birds and the trees.
	I'll blame it on the days, that ended one too soon
	I'll blame it on the nights that could not be
	But, my heart  blames it on me. (Your heart blames it on you this time).

BLOWIN' IN THE WIND
How many roads must a man walk down before you call him a man?
Yes and how many seas must a white dove sail before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes and how many times must the cannonballs fly before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind, the answer is blowin' in the wind.

How many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?
Yes and how many ears must one man have before he can hear people cry?
Yes and how many deaths will it take 'til he knows that too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind, the answer is blowin' in the wind.

How many years can a mountain exist before it is washed to the sea?
Yes and how many years can some people exist before they're allowed to be free?
Yes and how many times can a man turn his head and pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind, the answer is blowin' in the wind.

BLUE BAYOU
I feel so bad, I've got a worried mind, I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou

Savin' nickels, savin' dimes, workin' till the sun don't shine
Lookin' forward to happier times on Blue Bayou
I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Where those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be
Gonna see my baby again, gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again on Blue Bayou
I'm goin' back some day, gonna stay on Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Ah, that girl of mine by my side, the silver moon and the evening tide
Ah, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside
	I'll never be blue, my dreams come true on Blue Bayou
Savin' nickels, savin' dimes, workin' till the sun don't shine
Lookin' forward to happier times on Blue Bayou
I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Where those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be
Oh, that girl of mine by my side, the silver moon and the evenin' tide
Oh, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside
Well, I'll never be blue, my dreams come true on Blue Bayou

BLUEBERRY HILL
I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill, on Blueberry Hill when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill, and lingered un-til my dreams came true.
	The wind in the willow played love's sweet melody.
	But all of those vows we made were never to be.
Tho' we're apart, you're part of me still,
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill

LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL
Come on, baby, let the good times roll, come on, baby, let me thrill your soul
Come on, baby, let the good times roll, roll all night long,
Come on, baby, let me hold you tight, tell me everything will be all right
Come on, baby, let the good times roll, roll all night long.
    	Feels so good, when you're home, come on, baby, rock me all night long,
Come on, baby, let the good times roll, come on, baby, let me thrill your soul
Come on, baby, let the good times roll, roll all night long,

THE WAY YOU DO THE THINGS YOU DO
You got a smile so bright, you know you could've been a candle
I'm holding you so tight, you know you could've been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet, you know you could've been a broom
The way you smell so sweet, you know you could've been some perfume
Well, you could've been anything that you wanted to, and I can tell....
The way you do the things you do.
The way you do the things you do.

BLUE CHRISTMAS
I'll have a blue Christmas without you. I'll be so blue thinking about you.
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree won't mean a thing if you're not here with me.
I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain. And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white, but I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.

BLUE EYES CRYING IN THE RAIN
In the twilight glow I see her, blue eyes cryin' in the rain
When we kissed goodbye, and parted, I knew we'd never meet again
	Love is like a dyin' ember, only memories remain
	Through the ages I'll remember, blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Some day, when we meet up yonder, we'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no partin', blue eyes cryin' in the rain.

BLUE HAWAII
Night and you, and blue Hawaii.
The night is heavenly, and you are heaven to me
Lovely you, and blue Hawaii.
With all this loveliness, there should be love
	Come with me, while the moon is on the sea
	The night is young, and so are we, so are we
Dreams come true in blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true
This magic night of nights with you

BLUE MOON
Blue Moon you saw me standing alone, without a dream in my heart without a love of my own
Blue Moon you knew just what I was there for,
You heard me saying a prayer for someone I really could care for
       CHORUS:
	And then there suddenly appeared before me the only one my arms will ever hold
	I heard somebody whisper please adore me
	And when I looked the Moon had turned to gold
Blue Moon now I'm no longer alone, without a dream in my heart without a love of my own
       CHORUS

BLUE ON BLUE
	Blue on blue, heartache on heartache. Blue on blue now that we are through.
	Blue on blue, heartache on heartache, and I find I can't get over losing you.
I walk along the street we used to walk, two by two, lovers pass,
And as they're passing by, I could die, 'cause you're not here with me.
Now the trees are bare, there's sadness in the air, and I'm as blue as I can be.
	Blue on blue, heartache on heartache. Blue on blue now that we are through.
	Blue on blue, heartache on heartache, and I find I can't get over losing you.
Night after lonely night, we meet in dreams, as I run to your side,
You wait with open arms, open arms that now are closed to me.
Through a veil of tears, your vision disap-pears, And I'm as blue as I can be.
	Blue on blue, heartache on heartache. Blue on blue now that we are through.
	Blue on blue, heartache on heartache, and I find I can't get over losing you.

BLUESETTE
Poor little, sad little blue Bluesette, don't you cry, don't you fret
You can bet one lucky day you'll waken and your blues will be forsaken
One lucky day lovely love will come your way

Long as there's love in your heart to share, dear Bluesette, don't despair
Some blue boy is longing just like you to find a someone to be true to
Two loving arms he can nestle in and stay
	Get set, Bluesette, true love is coming. Your troubled heart soon will be humming.
	Hum..............................................................
	Dooya, dooya, dooya,dooya, dooya, dooya, doo- oo -  oo  Bluesette
	Pretty little Bluesette, mustn't be a mourner,
	Have you heard the news yet?  Love is 'round the corner
	Love wrapped in rainbows and tied with pink ribbon
	To make your next spring-time your gold wedding ring time
	So, dry your eyes, don't-cha pout, don't-cha fret, goody good times are coming, Bluesette
Long as there's love in your heart to share, dear Bluesette, don't despair
Some blue boy is longing, just like you, to find a someone to be true to
One lucky day lovely love will come your way
That magic day may just be today

BLUES IN THE NIGHT
My mama done tol' me, when I was in knee-pants/pig-tails, my mama done tol' me son/hon
A woman'll sweet talk/man's gonna sweet talk, and give you the big eye
But when the sweet talkin's done, a woman's a two face/man is a two-face
A worrisome thing who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night
	Now the rain's a-fallin', hear the train a-callin, whoo-ee, my mama done tol' me
	Hear that lonesome whistle blowin' cross the trestle, whoo-ee, my mama done tol' me
	A-whoo-ee-duh-whoo-ee, ol' clickety clack's a-echoin' back the blues in the night
     The evenin'  breeze'll start the trees to cryin', and the moon'll hide its light
     When you get the blues in the night
      Take my word, the mockin' bird'll sing the saddest kind o' song
      He knows things are wrong, and he's right
From Natchez to Mobile, from Memphis to St. Joe, wherever the four winds blow
I've been in some big towns, and heard me some big talk, but there is one thing I know
A woman's a two-face/a man is a two-face
A worrisome thing who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night
	My mama was right, there's blues in the night

BLUE SKIES
Blue skies smiling at me, nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue birds singing a song, nothing but blue birds all day long.
Never saw the sun shining so bright, never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by, when you're in love my how they fly
Blue days all of them gone, nothing but blue skies from now on.

BLUES ON A UKULELE
They say you can't play blues on a ukulele, but there they are wrong,
You went away and this is all I play, my ukulele sad song
They say you can't cry, and play a ukulele, well, what do they know?
I start to strum, and soon the tears will come, and then the blues just follow
     They say that there's no happier sound. That's not the case when you're not around.
They say you can't play blues on a ukulele, but, since we're apart
Oh, from that day, I can only play the strings of my broken heart.

BLUE SUEDE SHOES
Well, it's one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, now go cat go!
     CHORUS:
	But don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
	You can do anything, but lay off of my blue suede shoes.
Well, you can knock me down, step in my face slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you want to do but uh-uh, honey, lay off of my shoes...CHORUS
Well, you can burn my house, steal my car, drink my cider from my old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do but uh-uh, honey, lay off of my shoes...CHORUS
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes (X4), you can do anything, but lay off of my blue suede shoes.

BLUE VELVET
She wore blue velvet,  bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light from the stars
She wore blue velvet,  bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May her tender sighs love was ours
	 Ours, a love I held tightly, feeling the rapture grow
	  Like a flame burning brightly, but when she left,  gone was the glow
Of blue velvet,  but in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm, a memory, through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears
	 Ours, a love I held tightly, feeling the rapture grow
	  Like a flame burning brightly, but when she left,   gone was the glow
Of blue velvet,  but in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm, a memory, through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears



BOBBY SOX TO STOCKINGS
When a girl changes from bobby sox to stockings
And she starts trading her baby toys for boys
	When that once-shy little sleepyhead learns about love and its lilt
	You can bet that the change is more than from cotton to silk
If a miss wants to be kissed instead of cuddled
And to this, you are in doubt as what to say
	When a girl changes from bobby sox to stockings
	Then she's old enough to give her heart away

	When a girl changes from bobby sox to stockings
	Then she's old enough to give her heart, old enough to give her heart
	Then she's old enough to give her heart away, away, away, away

BODY AND SOUL
My heart is sad and lonely, for you I sigh, for you, dear, only
Why haven't you seen it? I'm all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longin', and wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it. I'm all for you body and soul
I can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it, that you'd turn away from romance
Are you pretending, it looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove, dear
My life a wreck you're making, you know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you, body and soul

BOOK OF LOVE
	(I wonder, wonder who, who-oo-ooh WHO? Who wrote the Book Of Love?)
Tell me, tell me, tell me, oh, who wrote the Book Of Love?
I've got to know the answer, was it someone from above?
	(Oh, I wonder, wonder who, mmbadoo-ooh, WHO? Who wrote the Book Of Love?)
I love you darlin,' baby, you know I do
But I've got to see this Book of Love, find out why it's true
	(Oh, I wonder, wonder who, mmbadoo-ooh, WHO? Who wrote the Book Of Love?)
(Chapter One says to love her, you love her with all your heart)
(Chapter Two you tell her you're never, never, never, never, ever gonna part)
(In Chapter Three remember the meaning of romance)
(In Chapter Four you break up, but you give her just one more chance))
	(Oh, I wonder, wonder who, mmbadoo-ooh, WHO? Who wrote the Book Of Love?)
Baby, baby, baby, I love you, yes I do
Well it says so in this Book Of Love, ours is the one that's true
	(Oh, I wonder, wonder who, mmbadoo-ooh, WHO? Who wrote the Book Of Love?)
I wonder who (YEAH), who wrote the Book Of Love?

BORN FREE
Born free, as free as the wind blows, as free as the grass grows
Born free, to follow your heart

Live free, and beauty surrounds you, the world still astounds you
Each time you look at a star
	Stay free, where no walls divide you
	You're free as the roaring tide, so there's no need to hide
Born free, and life is worth living, but only worth living, 'cause you're born free
	Stay free, where no walls divide you
	You're free as the roaring tide, so there's no need to hide
Born free, and life is worth living, but only worth living, 'cause you're born free

BORN TO BE WILD
Get your motor runnin', head out on the highway
Lookin' for adventure, and whatever comes our way
Yeah, Darlin', go make it happen, take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once, and explode into space

I like smoke and lightnin', heavy metal thunder
Racin' with the wind, and the feelin' that I'm under
Yeah, Darlin', go make it happen, take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once, and explode into space
     Like a true nature's child, we were born, born to be wild
     We can climb so high, I never wanna die
	Born to be wild, born to be wild
Get your motor runnin', head out on the highway
Lookin' for adventure, and whatever comes our way
Yeah, Darlin', go make it happen, take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once, and explode into space
     Like a true nature's child, we were born, born to be wild
     We can climb so high, I never wanna die
	Born to be wild, born to be wild

BOTH SIDES NOW
Rows and flows of angel hair, and ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done, but clouds got in my way
	I've looked at clouds from both sides now, from up and down, and still somehow
	It's clouds' illusions I recall, I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and ferris wheels, the dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real, I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show, you leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know, don't give yourself away
	I've looked at love from both sides now, from give and take, and still somehow
	It's love's illusions I recall, I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud, to say "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange, they shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained in living every day
	I've looked at life from both sides now, from win and lose and still somehow
	It's life's illusions I recall, I really don't know life at all
	It's life's illusions I recall, I really don't know life at all

BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS
I walk along the street of sorrow, the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where Gigolo and Gigolette can take a kiss without regret
And so forget their broken dreams

You laugh today, and cry tomorrow, when you behold your shattered schemes
And Gigolo and Gigolette wake up to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams
	Here is where you'll always find me, always walking up and down
	But I left my soul behind me in an old cathedral town
The joy that you find here, you borrow, you cannot keep it long, it seems
But Gigolo and Gigolette still sing a song, and dance along,
The Boulevard of Broken Dreams

BOUNCY BOUNCY BALLY
Bouncy bouncy bally, dribbledy drobbledy oopsy day
Bouncy bouncy bally, look at the way I play

Watch the bally fally, down on the ground, and then up again
Bouncy bouncy bally, look at me count to ten
     I'm smart, doodly do, so smart, doodly do
     'Cause I knew just how to do it from the start.
     It's brains, doodly do, that counts, doodly do.
     When my daddy gets home, I'll teach him how to bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bouncy bouncy bally, dribbledy drobbledy oopsy day
Bouncy bouncy bally, look at the way I play
     I'm smart, doodly do, so smart, doodly do
     'Cause I knew just how to do it from the start.
     It's brains, doodly do, that counts, doodly do.
     When my daddy gets home, I'll teach him how to bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bouncy bouncy bally, dribbledy drobbledy oopsy day
Bouncy bouncy bally, look at the way I play
I bouncy bouncy bally all the day

BRANDY (YOU'RE A FINE GIRL)
There's a port on a western bay, and it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away, and talk about their homes
There's a girl in this harbor town, and she works, laying whiskey down
They say "Brandy, fetch another round," she serves them whiskey and wine
	The sailors say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl, what a good wife you would be
	Your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea."
Brandy wears a braided chain, made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name of the man that Brandy loves
He came on a summer's day, bringing gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay, no harbor was his home
　　　　The sailor said, "Brandy, you're a fine girl, what a good wife you would be
　　　　But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea."
　　　　Brandy used to watch his eyes when he told his sailor's story
		She could feel the ocean fall and rise, she saw its raging glory
		But he had always told the truth, Lord, he was an honest man
		Brandy does her best to understand.
At night, when the bars close down, Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around, she still can hear him say..
	She hears him say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl, what a good wife you would be
　　　　But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea."

BRAZIL
Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June, we stood beneath an amber moon
And softly murmured "someday soon." We kissed and clung together
	Then, tomorrow was another day, the morning found me miles away
	With still a million things to say
Now, when twilight dims the sky above,  recalling thrills of our love
There's one thing I'm certain of-return, I will, to old brazil, to old Brazil

BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO
You tell me that you're leaving, I can't believe it's true.
Girl, there's just no living without you.
Don't take your love away from me. Don't you leave my heart in misery
If you go, then I'll be blue. Breaking up is hard to do.
Remember when you held me tight, and you kissed me all through the night.
Think of all that we've been through. Breaking up is hard to do.
	They say that breaking up is hard to do, now I know, I know that it's true.
	Don't say that this is the end, instead of breaking up I wish that we were making up again.
I beg of you, don't say goodbye, can't we give our love a brand new try?
Yeah, come on babe, let's start anew, 'cause breaking up is hard to do.
Breaking up is so very hard to do.

BREAK UP TO MAKE UP
Tell me what's wrong with you now, tell me why I
Never seem to make you happy, though heaven knows I try
What does it take to please you? Tell me just how
I can satisfy you, woman, you're driving me wild
	Break up to make up, that's all we do
	First you love me, then you hate me, that's a game for fools  (X2)
When I come home from working, you're on the phone
Talkin' 'bout how bad I treat you, now tell me I'm wrong
You say it's me who argues, I'll say it's you
We have got to get together, or, baby, we're through
	Break up to make up, that's all we do
	First you love me, then you hate me, that's a game for fools  (X2)
Break up to make up, that's all we do
Yeah, first you love me then you hate me, that's a game for fools
Break up to make up, that's all we do
First you love me then you hate me, that's a game for fools

BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER
When you're weary, feeling small. When tears are in your eyes, I'll dry them all
I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough, and friends just can't be found
	Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down
	Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down
When you're down and out, when you're on the street
When evening falls so hard, I will comfort you (ooo)
I'll take your part, oh, when darkness comes, and pain is all around
	Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down
	Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down
Sail on silver girl, sail on by. Your time has come to shine, all your dreams are on their way
See how they shine,  oh, if you need a friend, I'm sailing right behind
	Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down
	Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down

BRING BACK MY NEIGHBORS TO ME
Last night as I lay on my pillow
Last night as I lay on my bed
I stuck my feet out of the window
In the morning my neighbors were dead
Bring back, bring back, oh, bring back my neighbors to me, to me
Bring back, bring back, oh bring back my neighbors to me.

BRING IT ON HOME TO ME
If you ever change your mind about leavin', leavin' me behind
Baby, bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin'

BRING ME SUNSHINE
Bring me sunshine in your smile, make me happy all the while
In this world where we live there should be more happiness
So much joy we can give to each brand new bright tomorrow

Make me happy through the years, never bring me any tears
Let your arms be as warm as the sun from up above
Bring me fun, bring me sunshine, bring me love.

BRISTOL STOMP
The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol, when they do the Bristol Stomp
Really somethin' when they join in jumpin' when they do the Bristol Stomp
Whoa, whoa, the stars are spinnin' every Friday night, they dance the greatest, and they do it right
Well, here's the latest, it's a crazy sight to see
The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol, when they do the Bristol Stomp
Really somethin' when they join in jumpin' when they do the Bristol Stomp
Whoa, whoa it started in Bristol at a dee jay hop, they hollered and whistled never wanted to stop
We pony and twisted, and we rocked with Daddy G
The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol, when they do the Bristol Stomp
Really somethin' when they join in jumpin' when they do the Bristol Stomp
     It's got that groovy beat, that makes you stomp your feet.
     Come along and try, gonna feel fine
     And once you dance with me, you'll fall in love you see
     The Bristol Stomp will make you mine, all mine
The stars are spinnin' every Friday night, they dance the greatest if they do it right
But here's the latest, it's a crazy sight to see
The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol, when they do the Bristol Stomp
Really somethin' when they join in jumpin' when they do the Bristol Stomp

BROOKLYN BLUES
See, I flew in from the West Coast just the other day
Yes, I flew in from the West Coast, and we circled JFK
The movie ended, and I pulled up the shade, looked out the window, while the Muzak played
But in my head I'm singin', singin' the Brooklyn Blues. Oh, yeah.

When you're growin' up in Brooklyn, the Bridge is like a friend
Said, when you're growin' up in Brooklyn, that Bridge sure is your friend
Because that river looks a hundred miles wide, while all your dreams are on the other side
And that can start you singin', singin' the Brooklyn Blues. Oh, yeah.

Now, I've got myself some money, a mansion in Bel-Aire
Yes, I've spent a lot of money, and I've been most everywhere
But still, there's somethin' missin' I've got to find, a part of me I must've left behind
That makes a guy start feelin', feelin' those Brooklyn Blues

My, my, I've sung love songs to a princess, more than once or twice
I've sung rock and roll in Paris, jazz in Paradise
But there's a song of mine I couldn't have sung, a tune I started back when I was young
Now I've come home to finish, finish my Brooklyn Blues, my Brooklyn Blues

BROTHER, CAN YOU SPARE A DIME?
They used to tell me I was building a dream, and so I followed the mob
When there was earth to plow or guns to bear I was always there right on the job
They used to tell me I  was building a dream, with peace and glory ahead
Why should I be standing in line, just waiting for bread?
Once I built a railroad, I made it run, I made it run against time
Once I built a railroad, now it's done, brother, can you spare a dime?
Once I built a tower, up to the sun, bricks and mortar and lime
Once I built a tower, now it's done, brother, can you spare a dime?
Once in khaki suits, gee, we looked swell, full of that Yankee-Doodly-dum
Half a million boots went slogging through Hell, and I was the kid with the drum
Say, don't you remember, you called me "Al."  It was Al all the time.
Say, don't you remember, I was your pal, brother, can you spare a dime?

BROWN EYED GIRL
Hey, where did  we go, days when the rains came? Down in the hollow, playing a new game
Laughin' and a-runnin', hey, hey, skippin' and a-jumpin'
In the misty morning fog with our, our hearts a-thumpin'
And you, my brown-eyed girl, you, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow
Goin' down to the old mine with a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight, laughing, hide behind a rainbow's wall
Skippin' and a-slidin', all along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl, you, my brown-eyed girl
     Do you remember when we used to sing, "Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah", just like that
     Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
So hard to find my way, now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day. My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord, sometime I'm overcome, thinkin' about
Makin' love in the green grass with you, my brown eyed girl, you, my brown-eyed girl
     Do you remember when we used to sing, "Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah", just like that
     Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
     Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah, la dee dah

BUDDY HOLLY MEDLEY
EVERY DAY
Every day it's a-gettin' closer, going faster than a roller coaster,
Love like yours will surely come my way
Every day it's a-gettin' faster, everyone said, "go ahead and ask her"
Love like yours will surely come my way
	Every day seems a little longer, every way love's a little stronger
	Come what may, do you ever long for     true love from me?
Every day it's a-gettin' closer, going faster than a roller coaster,
Love like yours will surely come my way
Love like yours will surely come my way

IT'S SO EASY
	It's so easy to fall in love, it's so easy to fall in love
People tell me love's for fools, so here I go, breakin' all the rules
It seems so easy, so doggone easy, it seems so easy, where you're concerned, my heart has learned
	It's so easy to fall in love, it's so easy to fall in love
Look into your heart and see what your love book has set apart for me
It seems so easy, so doggone easy,  it seems so easy, where you're concerned, my heart has learned
	It's so easy to fall in love, it's so easy to fall in love

THAT'LL BE THE DAY
Well, you give me all your lovin' and your turtle dovin'
All your hugs and kisses and your money too
Well,  you know you love me, baby until you tell me, maybe
That some day, well, I'll be through!
	Well, that'll be the day, when you say, goodbye, yes
	That'll be the day, when YOU MAKE ME CRY, AH
	You say, you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie 'cause
	That'll be the day, when I die.
When Cupid shot his dart,..... he shot it at your heart......
So if we ever part and I leave you.....
You say you told me an' you......told me boldly,
That some day, well, I'll be through.    Well, (CHORUS   "That'll be the day....")

BUFFALO GALS
As I was walking down the street, down the street, down the street
A pretty girl I chanced to meet, under the silvery moon.
	Buffalo gals, won't you come out tonight, come out tonight, come out tonight,
	Buffalo gals, won't you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon.
I asked her if she'd stop and talk, stop and talk, stop and talk,
Her feet covered up the whole sidewalk, she was fair to view.
	REFRAIN
I asked her if she'd be my wife, be my wife, be my wife
Then I'd be happy all my life, if she'd marry me.
	REFRAIN

BUILD ME UP BUTTERCUP
	Why do you build me up (build me up), Buttercup, baby
	Just to let me down (let me down) and mess me around
	And then worst of all (worst of all), you never call, baby
	When you say you will (say you will), but I love you still
	I need you (I need you) more than anyone, darlin', you know that I have from the start.
	So build me up Buttercup, don't break my heart
"I'll be over at ten," you told me time and a-gain,  but you're late, I wait a-round and then
I went to the door, I can't take any more, it's not you, you let me down again
	(Hey, hey, hey!) Baby, baby, try to find (Hey, hey, hey!) a little time and I'll make you happy
	I'll be home, I'll be be-side the phone, waiting for you, ooo-oo-ooo, ooo-oo-ooo
To you I'm a toy but I could be the boy you a-dore, if you'd just let me know
Al-though you're un-true, I'm at-tracted to you all the more, why do I need you so
	So build me up Buttercup, don't break my heart
	I need you more than anyone, darlin', you know that I have from the start.
	So build me up Buttercup, don't break my heart

BURNING LOVE
Lord Almighty, I feel my temperature risin'. Higher 'n' higher, it's burnin' through to my soul
Girl, girl, girl, you gonna set me on fire. My brain is flaming, I don't know which way to go
	Your kisses lift me higher, like the sweet song of a choir
	You light my morning sky with burnin' love
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I feel my temperature rising. Help me, I'm flaming, I must be a hundred and nine
Burnin', burnin', burnin', and nothin' can cool me. I just might turn to smoke, but I feel fine
	'Cause your kisses lift me higher, like the sweet song of a choir
	And you light my mornin' sky with burnin' love
It's comin' closer, the flames are now lickin' my body.
Won't you help me? I feel like I'm slippin' away
It's hard to breath, and my chest is a-heavin'
Lord, have mercy, I'm burnin' a hole where I lay
	'Cause your kisses lift me higher, like the sweet song of a choir
	You light my mornin' sky with burnin' love, with burnin' love
     I'm just a hunk, a hunk of burnin' love, just a hunk, a hunk of burnin' love
     Just a hunk, a hunk of burnin' love, just a hunk, a hunk of burnin' love  (repeat and fade)

BURPING BUBBLES
Tiny bubbles in my Coke, make me hiccup, make me choke,
Tiny bubbles make me shake all over,
With the feeling that I'm gonna burp until the end of time.
So here's to soda pop, it's good to the very last drop, but if you drink too much, your teeth will rot!
Tiny bubbles in my Coke, make me hiccup, make me choke,
Tiny bubbles make me shake all over,
With the feeling that I'm gonna burp until the end of time.
With the feeling that I'm gonna belch until the end of time.

BUSHEL AND A PECK
I love you a bushel and a peck, a bushel and a peck and a hug around the neck
Hug around the neck and a barrel and a heap, barrel and a heap and I'm talkin' in my sleep
	About you, about you, 'cause I love you a bushel and a peck, y' bet your pretty neck I do.
	Doodle oodle doodle, doodle oodle doodle, doodle oodle oodle ooo.
I love you a bushel and a peck, a bushel and a peck though you make my heart a wreck
Make my heart a wreck and you make my life a mess, make my life a mess, yes a mess of happiness
	About you, about you, 'cause I love you a bushel and a peck, y' bet your pretty neck I do.
	Doodle oodle doodle, doodle oodle doodle, doodle oodle oodle ooo.

BUS STOP
Bus stop, wet day, she's there,  I say, "Please share my umbrella."
Bus stop, bus goes,  she stays, love grows under my umbrella
All that summer we enjoyed it, wind and rain and shine
That umbrella, we employed it, by August, she was mine
	Every morning I would see her waiting at the stop
	Sometimes she'd shop and she would show me what she bought
	Other people stared as if we were both quite in-sane
	Someday my name and hers are going to be the same
That's the way the whole thing started, silly but it's true
Thinkin' of a sweet romance,  beginning in a  queue
Came the sun the ice was melting, no more sheltering now
Nice to think that  that umbrella led me to  a vow
	Every morning I would see her waiting at the stop
	Sometimes she'd shop and she would show me what she bought
	Other people stared as if we were both quite in-sane
	Someday my name and hers are going to be the same

BUT NOT FOR ME
Old Man Sunshine, listen, you, never tell me dreams come true.
Just try it, and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare ever  tell me she will care.
I'm certain, It's the final cutain.
Don't want to hear from and cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell me love will find a way, it's all bananas.

They're writing songs of love, but not for me. A lucky star's above, but not for me,
With love to lead the way, I found more clouds of grey, than any Russian play could guarantee.
I was a fool to fall, and get that way. Hi ho! Alas! And also Lack a day!
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss, I guess she's not for me.

BUT SHE LOVES ME
She likes to travel to parts unknown, and see the wonders before they're gone
She always wanted to write a book, she hates to cook, but she loves me

I tell her one day we'll have the time, to conquer Everest, and cross the Rhine
We'll shoot the rapids, and tame the wild.
She simply smiles and says she loves me.

I wanted children, she bore the pain, she dearly loves them, but felt the change

Now that they're grown up and on their own,
she could have gone, but she loves me, she loves me.
I tell her one day we'll have the time to conquer Everest, and cross the Rhine
We'll shoot the rapids, and tame the wild,
She simply smiles and says she loves me, she loves me

BUTTON UP YOUR OVERCOAT
Button up your overcoat when the wind is free
Take good care of yourself, you belong to me
Eat an apple every day, get to bed by three
Take good care of yourself, you belong to me
	Be careful crossing streets, oo oo, don't eat meats, oo oo, cut out sweets, oo oo
	You'll get a pain and ruin your tum tum!
Keep away from bootleg hootch when you're on a spree
Take good care of yourself, you belong to me

Button up your overcoat when the wind is free
Take good care of yourself, you belong to me.
Wear your flannel underwear when you climb a tree
Take good care of yourself, you belong to me.
	Don't sit on hornets' tails, oo oo, or on nails, oo oo, or third rails, oo oo
	You'll get a pain and ruin your tum tum!
Don't go out with college boys when you're on a spree
Take good care of yourself (X3), you belong to me!

BYE BYE BLACKBIRD
Pack up all my cares and woes, here I go, singin' low, bye, bye blackbird
Where somebody waits for me, sugar's sweet, so is she, bye, bye, blackbird.
No one here to love and understand me, oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, blackbird, blackbird, bye, bye.

BYE BYE, BLUES
Bye, bye, blues, bye, bye, blues; bells ring, birds sing, sun is shining, no more pining
Just we two, smiling through; don't sigh, don't cry, bye, bye, blues.

BYE, BYE, LOVE
Bye, bye, love, bye, bye happiness, hello loneliness, I think I'm gonna cry
Bye, bye, love, bye, bye sweet caress, hello emptiness, I feel like I could die,
Bye, bye, my love, goodbye.
There goes my baby with someone new; she sure looks happy I sure am blue
She was my baby till he stepped in; goodbye to romance that might have been
  CHORUS  ("Bye, bye, love.......")
I'm through with romance, I'm through with love.
I'm through with countin' the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free:
My lovin' baby is through with me    CHORUS (Bye, bye, love....)

BY MYSELF
I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance

I'll try to apply myself, and teach my heart how to sing
I'll go my way by myself, like a bird on the wing
	I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own
	No one knows better than I myself, I'm by myself alone

BY THE BEAUTIFUL SEA
By the sea, by the sea, by the beautiful sea, you and me, you and me, oh, how happy we'll be
When each wave comes a-rolling in we will duck or swim
And we'll float and look around the water
Over and under and then up for air, Pa is rich, Ma is rich, so now what do we care?
I love to be beside your side, beside the sea, beside the seaside, by the beautiful sea.

BY THE LIGHT OF THE SILVERY MOON
By the light of the silvery moon, I want to spoon, to my honey I'll croon love's tune
Honey-moon, keep a shinin' in June
Your silvery beams will bring love's dreams,
We'll be cuddlin' soon, by the silvery moon.
By the light (not the dark, but the light) of the silvery moon (not the sun, but the moon)
I want to spoon (not knife, but spoon), to my honey I'll croon love's tune.
Honey-moon, (not the sun, but the moon), keep a'shinin' in June (not May, but June)
Your silvery beams will bring love's dreams, we'll be cuddlin' soon, (not later, but soon)            .
By the silvery moon (not the gold – en    moon!)

BY THE TIME I GET TO PHOENIX
By the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be risin'.  She'll find the note I left hangin' on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leavin',
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before.

By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be workin', she'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin' off the wall, that's all

By the time I make Oklahoma, she'll be sleepin', she'll turn softly and call my name out low
And cry just to think I'd really leave her, though time and time again I've tried to tell her so
She just didn't know I would really go.

CABARET
"What good is sitting alone In your room? Come hear the music play.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum, come to the Cabaret.
Put down the knitting, The book and the broom, it's time for a holiday.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum, come to the Cabaret.
	Come taste the wine, come hear the band, come blow a horn, start celebrating;
	Right this way, your table's waiting.
What good's permitting Some prophet of doom to wipe every smile away.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum, so come to the Cabaret!

I used to have a girlfriend Known as Elsie, with whom I shared A four sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you'd call a blushing flower...as a matter of fact she rented by the hour.
The day she died the neighbors Came to snicker:
"Well, that's what comes from too much pills and liquor."
But when I saw her laid out like a Queen, she was the happiest... corpse... I'd ever seen.
I think of Elsie to this very day. I remember how she'd turn to me and say:
"What good is sitting all alone in you room? Come hear the music play.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum, come to the Cabaret.
And as for me, and as for me, I made my mind up, back in Chelsea,
When I go, I'm going like Elsie.

Start by admitting, From cradle to tomb, it isn't that a long a stay.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum, it's only a Cabaret, old chum
And I love a Cabaret.

CAB DRIVER
Cab driver, drive by Mary's place, I just want a chance to see her face
Don't stop the meter, let it race, cab driver, drive by Mary's place
	Cab driver, once more 'round the block, never mind the ticking of the clock
	I only wish we could have had a talk, cab driver, once more 'round the block
Cab driver, once more down her street, there's a little place we used to eat
That's where I laid my future at her feet, cab driver, once more down her street
	Cab driver, wait here by her door, I just want to hold her in my arms once more
	Then things may be just like they were before, cab driver, wait here by her door
Cab driver, you better take me home, I guess that I was meant to be alone
I hope God sends me a loved one of my own, cab driver, better take me home
Cab driver, better take me home, cab driver, better take me home

CALIFORNIA DREAMIN'
All the leaves are brown, the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm, if I was in L.A.
　　　　California dreamin' on such a winter's day
Stopped into a church I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees, and I began to pray
You know the preacher likes the cold, he knows I'm gonna stay
　　　　California dreamin' on such a winter's day
All the leaves are brown, the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
If I didn't tell her, I could leave today
　　　　California dreamin' on such a winter's day  (X3)

CALIFORNIA HERE I COME
     When the wintry winds starts blowing, and the snow is starting in the fall
     Then my eyes went westward knowing, that's the place that I love best of all
     California, I've been blue, since I've been a-way from you
     I can't wait 'till I get going, even now, I'm startin' in to call
California, here I come right back where I started from
Where bowers of flowers bloom in the spring
Each morning, at dawning, birdies sing at every-thing
A sun-kissed miss said, "don't be late!" That's why I can hardly wait
Open up that golden gate, California, here I come

CAMPTOWN RACES
O the Camptown ladies sing this song, dooda dooda
The Camptown race track's five miles long, oh dooda day
Goin' to run all night,
Goin' to run all day
I bet my money on a bob-tailed nag,
Somebody bet on the bay.
I went down South with my hat caved in, dooda dooda
I come back North with a  pocket full of tin, oh dooda day
	CHORUS

CANADIAN SUNSET
Once I was alone, so lonely and then,
You came, out of nowhere, like the sun, up from the hills.
Cold, cold was the wind, warm, warm were your lips,
Out there, on that ski trail, where your kiss filled me with thrills.
       A weekend in Canada, a change of scene,  was the most I bargained for.
      And then I discovered you, and in your eyes,  I found a love that I couldn't ig-nore.
Down, down came the sun. Fast, fast, fast beat my heart.
I knew, when the sun set, from that day we'd never part.
I knew, when the sun set,  from that day we'd never, ever part.

CANDY
Candy, I call my sugar Candy, because I'm sweet on Candy, and Candy's sweet on me
She understands me, my understanding Candy
And Candy's always handy when I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of her so I could love much more of him/her
She has taken my complete heart, got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart
Candy, it's gonna be just dandy, the day I take my Candy, and make her mine, all mine

CANDY KISSES
Candy kisses, wrapped in paper, mean more to you than any of mine
Candy kisses, wrapped in paper, you'd rather have them any old time
	You don't mean it when you whisper those sweet love words in my ear
	Candy kisses, wrapped in paper, mean more to you than mine do, dear

I built a castle out of dreams, dear. I thought that you were building too
Now my castles all have fallen, and I am left alone and blue
	Once my heart was filled with gladness, now there's sadness, only tears
	Candy kisses, wrapped in paper, mean more to you than mine do, dear
	Mean more to you than mine do, dear

THE CANDY MAN/PURE IMAGINATION
Who can take a sun rise, sprinkle it with dew,
Cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two, the Candy Man, the Candy Man can
The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good

Who can take a rainbow, wrap it in a sigh,
Soak it in the sun and make a strawberry pie, the Candy Man, the Candy Man can
The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good
	The Candy Man makes everything he bakes satisfying and delicious
	Now you talk about your childhood wishes, you can even eat the dishes
Who can take tomorrow, dip it in a dream,
Separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream, the Candy Man, the Candy Man can
The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good  (X2)


Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination
Come with me and you'll see into your imagination
We'll begin with a spin traveling in a world of my creation
What you'll see will defy explan-ation
	If you want to view paradise, simply turn around and view it
	Anything you want to, do it, want to change the world, there's nothing to it
There is no life I know that compares with pure imagination
Living there you'll be free if you truly want to be

CAN'T BUY ME LOVE
Can't buy me lo-ove,   lo-ove, can't buy me lo-ove
I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend if it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything my friend, if it makes you feel alright
'Cause I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love.

I'll give you all I've got to give, if you say you want me too
I may not have a lot to give, but what I got I'll give to you
'Cause I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love.
	Can't buy me lo-ove, everybody tells me so
	Can't buy me lo-ove, no, no, no....NO!
Say you don't need no diamond ring and I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things that money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love.
	Can't buy me lo-ove, lo-ove, can't buy me lo-o-ove.

CAN'T GET USED TO LOSING YOU
Guess there's no use in hangin' 'round, guess I'll get dressed and do the town
I'll find some crowded avenue, though it will be empty without you
	Can't get used to losing you, no matter what I try to do
	Gonna live my whole life through....loving you
Called up some girl I used to know. After I heard her say "Hello"
Couldn't think of anything to say, since you're gone it happens every day
	Can't get used to losing .....
I'll find somebody, wait and see. Who am I kidding, only me
For no one else could take your place, guess that I am just a hopeless case
	Can't get used to losing .....

CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE
Wise men say only fools rush in, but I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin, if I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows, surely to the sea, darling, so it goes, some things are meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life, too, for I can't help falling in love with you

CAN'T I
Can't I, will I, ever love you again? Tell me, why then can't I?
Maybe others want you, just like I do. Tell me, when then can't I?
You might have known others, so have I, who would hurt you, and desert you
That's why I only want to hold you, always, never to let you go. Tell me, why then can't ?

You might have known others, so have I, who would hurt you, and desert you
That's why I only want to hold you, always, never to let you go. Tell me, why then can't ?

CAN'T SMILE WITHOUT YOU
You know I can't smile without you, I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing, I'm finding it hard to do anything
You see I feel sad when you're sad, I feel glad when you're glad
If you only knew what I'm going through, I just can't smile without you
	You came along, just like a song, and brightened my day
	Who'd have believed that you were part of a dream, now it all seems light years away
And now you know I can't smile without you, I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing, I'm finding it hard to do any-thing
You see I feel sad when your sad, I feel glad when you're glad
If you only knew what I'm going through, I just can't smile
	Now some people say happiness takes so very long to find
	Well, I'm finding it hard leaving your love behind me
And you see I can't smile without you, I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing, I'm finding it hard to do any-thing
You see I feel glad when you're glad I feel sad when you're sad,
If you only knew what I'm going through, I just can't smile without you

CAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF OF YOU 
You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch, I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived, and I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off of you 
	Pardon the way that I stare, there's nothing else to compare
	The sight of you leaves me weak, there are no words left to speak
	But if you feel like I feel, please let me know that it's real
	You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off of you
 		Instrumental interlude 
I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right, I need you, baby
To warm the lonely night, I love you baby, trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray, oh pretty baby,
Now that I've found you,  stay, and  let me love you, baby, let me love you 
	You're just too good to be true.....

CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS
	I took each word she said as gospel truth, the way a silly little child would.
	I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
	She didn't mean it, I should have seen it, but now it's too  late.
I  thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, now it seems,  this is how the story ends
She's gonna turn me down and say, "Can't we be friends?"
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, not for long, I can see the way this ends
She's gonna turn me down and say, "Can't we be friends?"
	Why  should I care though she gave me the  air,
	Why should I cry,  heave a sigh, and wonder why,
I thought I found the girl I could trust, what a bust, this is how the sto ry ends
She's gonna turn me down and say, "Can't we be just friends?"

CAN'T YOU HEAR MY HEARTBEAT
Every time I see you lookin' my way, baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
In the car or walkin' down the highway, baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
When you move up closer to me, I get a feeling that's ooo-wee
	Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat?
	'Cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love
When I feel you put your arms around me, baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Then I'm glad, I'm mighty glad I found you, baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
When you asked me to meet your ma, I knew that baby, we'd be going far
	Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat?
	'Cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love
All my friends are cryin' out to meet you, baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Now's the time to go and see the preacher, baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Wedding bells are gonna chime, baby, baby, you're gonna be mine
	Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat?
	'Cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?   (X4)

CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE TONIGHT
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day, when the heat of a rollin' wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through, it's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you
	And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
	It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far
	And can you feel the love tonight?  How it's laid to rest
    	It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best
There's a time for everyone, if they only learn, that the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors,
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours
	And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
	It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far

	And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
	It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best
	It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best

CAN YOU PICTURE THAT?
Everybody's lover, everybody's brother, I wanna be your lifetime friend
Crazy as a rocket, nothin' in my pocket, I keep it at the rainbow's end
I never think of money, I think of milk 'n honey, grinnin' like a Cheshire cat
I focus on the pleasure, somethin' I can treasure, can you picture that? Can you picture that?

Let me take your picture, add it to the mixture, there it is I got you now
Really nothin' to it, anyone can do it, it's easy and we all know how
Now begins the changin', mental rearrangin', nothing's really where it's at
Now the Eiffel Tower's holdin up a flower, I gave it to a Texas cat  X2
	Fact is there's nothin' out there you can't do, yeah, even Santa Claus believes in you
	Beat down the walls, begin, believe, be, begat
	Be a better drummer, be an up and comer Can you picture that? Can you picture that
All of us are winnin, pickin and a-grinnin, Lordy but I love to jam
Jelly-belly gigglin', dancin' and a-wigglin', honey that's the way I am
Lost my heart in Texas, Northern lights affect us, I keep it underneath my hat
Aurora Borealis, shining down on Dallas, can you picture that? Can you picture that?
   Can you picture? You gotta see it in your mind. Can you picture? You know it's quick and easy to find
   Can you picture? You don't have to buy a frame. Can you picture? Can you picture that?
   Use it if you need it, don't forget to feed it. Can you picture that?

CARAVAN
Night and stars above that shine so bright, the mystery of their fading light
That shines upon our Caravan
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep, across the sands, so I may keep
this memory of our Caravan
	This is so exciting, you are so inviting,
	Resting in my arms, as I thrill to the magic charms of..
You, beside me here beneath the blue, my dream of love is coming true
Within our desert Caravan.

CAREFREE HIGHWAY
Picking up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream
I wonder how the old folks are tonight
Her name was Ann and I'll be damned if I recall her face
She left me not knowing what to do

Carefree highway, let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, you've seen better days
The morning-after blues, from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away, slip away on you

Turning back the pages to the times I love best
I wonder if she'll ever do the same
Now the thing that I call living is just being satisfied
With knowing I got no one left to blame

Carefree highway, I've got to see you, my old flame
Carefree highway, you've seen better days
The morning-after blues, from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away, slip away on you

Searching through the fragments of my dream shattered sleep
I wonder if the years have closed her mind
I guess it must be wanderlust or trying to get free
From the good old faithful feeling we once knew

Carefree highway, let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, you've seen better days
The morning-after blues, from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away, slip away on you, let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, got to see you, my old flame
Carefree highway, you've seen better days
The morning-after blues, from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away, slip away on you

CARELESS WHISPER
I feel so unsure, as I take your hand, and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes
     I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm
     Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
     I should've known better than to cheat a friend, and waste the chance that I've been given
     So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you

Time can never mend the careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth. Pain is all you'll find
     I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm
     Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
     I should've known better than to cheat a friend, and waste the chance that I've been given
     So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you
	Tonight the music seems so loud, I wish that we could lose this crowd
	Maybe it's better this way. We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
	We could have been so good together, we could have lived this dance forever
	But now who's gonna dance with me? Please stay
     I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm
     Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
     I should've known better than to cheat a friend, and waste the chance that I've been given
     So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you
(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone) Was what I did so wrong
So wrong that you had to leave me alone?

CAROLINA IN MY MIND
In my mind I'm gone to Carolina. Can't you see the sunshine, can't you just feel the moon shinin'?
Ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind.

Karen she's a silver sun, you best walk her way and watch it shine,
Watch her watch the morning come.
A silver tear appearing now I'm crying, ain't I? I'm gone to Carolina in my mind.

There ain't no doubt in no one's mind that love's the finest thing around,
Whisper something soft and kind.
And hey, babe, the sky's on fire, I'm dying, ain't I? I'm gone to Carolina in my mind.
  CHORUS
Dark and silent late last night, I think I might have heard the highway calling.
Geese in flight and dogs that bite.
And signs that might be omens say I'm goin', goin', I'm gone to Carolina in my mind.

With a holy host of others standing round me, still I'm on the dark side of the moon.
And it seems like it goes on like this forever, you must forgive me
If I'm up and gone to Carolina in my mind.
   CHORUS

CAROLINA IN THE MORNING
Nothing could be finer than to  be  in Caro-li-na in the morn---ing,
No one could be sweeter than my sweetie when I meet her in the morn---ing.
Where the morning glories twine around the door,
Whispering pretty stories I long to hear once more.
Strolling with my girlie where the dew is pearly early in the morn---ing,
Butterflies all flutter up and kiss each little buttercup at dawn--ing,
If  I had Aladdin's lamp for only a day, I'd  make a wish and here's what I'd say:
Nothing could be finer than to be in Caro-li-na in the morn-------ing.

CAROLINA MOON
Carolina moon  keep shining, shining on the one who waits for me
Carolina moon I'm pining, pining for the place I long to be
How I'm hoping tonight you'll go, go to the right window
Scatter your light say I'm all right please do
Tell her that I'm blue and lonely, dreamy Carolina moon

CARRIE ANNE
　　　　Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo, Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo
　　　　Hey, Carrie Anne, hey, Carrie Anne
When we were at school our games were simple, I played the janitor, you played the monitor
Then you played with older boys and prefects, what's the attraction in what they're doing
	Hey, Carrie Anne, what's your game now, can anybody play?  (X2)
You were always something special to me, quite independent, never caring
You lost your charm as you were aging, where is your magic, disappearing
	Hey, Carrie Anne, what's your game now, can anybody play?  (X2)
     You're so, so like a woman to me (so like a woman to me)
     So, so like a woman to me (like a woman to me)
	Hey, Carrie Anne, what's your game now, can anybody play?  (X2)
People live and learn but you're still learning, you use my mind and I'll be your teacher
When the lesson's over you'll be with me, then I'll hear the other people saying
	Hey, Carrie Anne, what's your game now, can anybody play?  (X2)
      	Carrie Anne, Carrie Anne, Carrie Anne, Carrie Anne

A CASE OF YOU
Just before our love got lost, you said, "I am as constant as the Northern Star,"
And I said, "Constantly in the darkness, where's that at? If you want me, I'll be in the bar."
On the back of a cartoon coaster, in the blue TV screen light, I drew a map of Canada.
Oh, Canada, with your face sketched on it twice
Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine, you taste so bitter and so sweet
	Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling, and I would still be on my feet
	Oh, I would still be on my feet.
Oh, I am a lonely painter, I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil, and I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
I remember the time you told me, you said love is touching souls
Surely you touched mine, 'cause part of you pours out of me in these lines from time to time
Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine, taste so bitter and so sweet
	Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling, and I would still be on my feet
	Oh, I would still be on my feet.
I met a woman, she had a mouth like yours, she knew your lies
She knew your devils and your deeds, and she said
Go to him, stay with him, if you can, but be prepared to bleed.
Oh, but you are in my blood, you're my holy wine, you're so bitter, baby, bitter and so sweet
	Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling, and I would still be on my feet
	Oh, I would still be on my feet.

CATCH A FALLING STAR
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket, never let it fade away.
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket, save it for a rainy day.
For love may come and tap you on the shoulder, some starless night.
And just in case you feel you want to hold her, you'll have a pocket full of starlight.
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket, never let it fade away
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket, save it for a rainy day.
For when your troubles start in multiplying and they just might.
It's easy to forget them without trying, with just a pocket full of starlight.
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket, never let it fade away.
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket, save it for a rainy day.
Save it for a rainy day, save it for a rainy day.

CATCH THE WIND
In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty, I want to be in the warm hold of your loving mind
To feel you all around me, and to take your hand along the sand
	Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
When sundown pales the sky, I want to hide a while behind your smile,
And everywhere I'd look your eyes I'd find
For me to love you now would be the sweetest thing, it's what'd make me sing
	Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
		Dee dee de dee..........
When rain has hung the leaves with tears, I want you near to kill my fears
To help me to leave all my blues behind
For standing in your heart is where I want to be, and long to be
	Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind  (X3)

CATCH US IF YOU CAN
Here they come again, mmm, mm, mm. Catch us if you can, mmm, mm, mm.
Time to get a move on, mmm, mm, mm. We, we yell with all of our might.
	Catch us if you can, catch us if you can. Catch us if you can, catch us if you can
Now we gotta run, mmm, mm, mm. No more time for fun, mmm, mm, mm
When we're gettin' angry, mmm, mm, mm, we, we yell with all of our might
	Catch us if you can, catch us if you can. Catch us if you can, catch us if you can
Here they come again, mmm, mm, mm. Catch us if you can, mmm, mm, mm.
Time to get a move on, mmm, mm, mm. We, we yell with all of our might.
	Catch us if you can, catch us if you can. Catch us if you can, catch us if you can

CATHY'S CLOWN
	Don't want your love any  more
	Don't want your kisses that's for sure
	I die each time I hear this sound
	Here he comes that's Cathy's clown
I've gotta stand tall. You know a man can't crawl
For when he knows you tell lies, and he hears 'em passin' by, he's not a man at all
When you see me shed a tear and you know that it's sin-cere
Don'tcha think it's kinda sad that you're treatin' me so bad, or don't you even care

CAT'S IN THE CRADLE
My child arrived just the other day, he came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay, he learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew, he'd say "I'm gonna be like you, Dad,
You know I'm gonna be like you"

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home, Dad, I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

My son turned ten just the other day, he said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw", I said "Not today, I got a lot to do", he said, "That's ok"
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed,  And said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him"

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home, Dad, I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

Well, he came from college just the other day, so much like a man I just had to say
"Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while," he shook his head and said with a smile
"What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys, see you later, can I have them please"

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home, son, I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad,
You know we'll have a good time then

I've long since retired, my son's moved away, I called him up just the other day
I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind," He said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,but it's sure nice talking to you, Dad,
It's been sure nice talking to you"

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me, he'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home, son, I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad,
You know we'll have a good time then

CECILIA
Does your mother know you're out, Cecilia? Does she know that I'm about to steal you?
Oh, my, when I look in your eyes, something tells me you and I should get together

How about a little kiss, Cecilia, just a kiss you'll never miss, Cecilia
Why do we two keep on wasting time, oh, Cecilia, say that you'll be mine

A CERTAIN SMILE
A certain smile, a certain face,  can lead an unsuspecting heart on a merry chase
A fleeting glance can say so many lovely things, suddenly you know why my heart sings

You love a while and when love goes, you try to hide the tears inside with a cheerful pose.
But in the hush of night exactly like a bittersweet refrain
Comes that certain smile to haunt your heart again

C'EST MAGNIFIQUE
When love comes in and takes you for a spin, oo, la, la, la, c'est magnifique
When every night your loved one holds you tight, oo, la, la, la, c'est magnifique
But when, one day, your loved one drifts away, oo, la, la, la, it is so tragique
But when, once more, she whispers "Je t'adore," c'est magnifique.

La vie est la, qui vous prend par le bras, oo, la, la, la, c'est magnifique
Des jours tout bleus, des baisers lumineux, c'est magnifique
Donner son coeur, avec un bouquet d'fleurs, oo, la, la, la, mais c'est magnifique
Et faire un jour un mariage d'amour, c'est magnifique

C'EST SI BON
C'est si bon, lovers say that in France, when they thrill to romance
It means that it's so good
C'est si bon, so I say to you, like the French people do, because it's, oh, so good!
Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear
Leads to only one thought, and it's this, dear
C'est si bon, nothing else can replace, just your stylish embrace
And if you only would, be my own for the rest of my days
I will whisper this phrase, my darling, my darling, c'est si bon!

C'est si bon, de partir, n'importe ou, bras dessus, bras dessous
En chantant des chansons
C'est si bon, de se dire des mots doux, des petits riens du tout
Mais qui en disent long
En voyant notre mi ne ravie, les passants dans la rue nous envient
Oh, c'est si bon, de guetter dans ses yeux. Un espoir merveilleux qui donne le frisson
C'est si bon, ces petites sensations, ca vaut mieux qu'un million
C'est tellement, tellement bon!

CHAINS
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains, and they ain't the kind that you can see
     Whoa, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Chains, well, I can't break away from these chains, can't run around', 'cause I'm not free
     Whoa, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah
	Now believe me when I tell you, I think you're fine
	I'd like to love you,  but, darling, I'm imprisoned by these...
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains, and they ain't the kind that you can see
     Whoa, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
	I wanna tell you, pretty baby, your lips look sweet
	I'd like to kiss them, but I can't break away from all these...
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains, and they ain't the kind that you can see
     Whoa, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Chains, chains of love, chains of love (fade)

CHANCES ARE
Chances are 'cause I wear a silly grin, the moment you come into view,
Chances are you think that I'm in love with you.
Just because my composure sort of slips, the moment that your lips meet mine,
Chances are you think my heart's your Valentine.
	In the magic of moonlight, when I sigh, "Hold me close, dear,"
	Chances are you believe the stars that fill the skies are in my eyes.
Guess you feel you'll always be the one and only one for me
And, if you think you could, well, chances are your chances are awfully good.

CHANGE PARTNERS
Must you dance every dance with that same fortunate man
You have danced with him since the music began
Won't you change partners, and dance with me.
Must you dance quite so close, with your lips touching his face
Oh, can't you see I'm longing to be in his place.
Won't you change partners, and dance with me
	Ask him to sit this one out, and while you're alone
	I'll tell the waiter to tell him he's wanted on the telephone
You've been locked in his arms, ever since heaven knows when
Won't you change partners and then you may never want to change partners again.

CHANGES IN LATTITUDES, CHANGES IN ATTITUDES
I took off for a weekend last month, just to try and recall the whole year.
All of the faces and all of the places, wonderin' where they all disappeared.
I didn't ponder the question too long. I was hungry and went out for a bite.
Ran into a chum with a bottle of rum, and we wound up drinkin' all night.
     It's those changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes nothing remains quite the same.
     With all of our running and all of our cunning, if we couldn't laugh, we would all go insane.
Reading departure signs in some big airport reminds me of the places I've been.
Visions of good times that brought so much pleasure makes me want to go back again.
If it suddenly ended tomorrow, I could somehow adjust to the fall.
Good times and riches and son of a bitches, I've seen more than I can recall
     These changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes, nothing remains quite the same.
     Through all of the islands and all of the highlands, if we couldn't laugh we would all go insane
I think about Paris when I'm high on red wine, I wish I could jump on a plane.
And so many nights I just dream of the ocean, God, I wish I was sailin' again.
Oh, yesterdays are over my shoulder, so I can't look back for too long.
There's just too much to see waiting in front of me, and I know that I just can't go wrong
     With these changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes, nothing remains quite the same.
     With all of my running and all of my cunning, if I couldn't laugh, I just would go insane
     If we couldn't laugh, we just would go insane
     If we weren't all crazy, we would go insane!

CHANUKAH, O CHANUKAH
Oh Chanukah, Oh Chanukah, come light the Menorah,
Let's have a party, we'll all dance the hora.
Gather round the table, we'll give you a treat.
Dreydls to play with, Latkes to eat.
And while we are playing,
The candles are burning low.
One for each night, they shed a sweet light,
To remind us of days long ago.
One for each night, they shed a sweet light,
To remind us of days long ago.

OY KHANIKE

A lustiker, a freylekher, nito nokh azeyner.

CHAPEL OF LOVE
Spring is here and the sky is so very blue, wo-o-o-oh
Birds all sing, as if they knew
Today's the day we'll say "I do," and we'll never be lonely any more.
	Because we're goin' to the chapel and we're gonna get married
	Goin' to the chapel and we're gonna get married
	Gee I really love you and we're gonna get married, goin' to the chapel of love.
Bells  will ring, and the sun is gonna shine, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh,
I'm gonna be his, and.. he's gonna be mine
We're gonna love, until the end of time, and we'll never be lonely any more.
	CHORUS

CHARLESTON
Charleston, charleston, made in Carolina. Some dance, some prance I'll say better than finer
Than the charleston, charleston, boy, how you can shuffle
         Every step you do leads to something new. Man, I'm telling you it's a lopazoo
Buck dance, wing dance will be a back number
But the charleston, the new charleston, that dance is surely a comer
	Sometime you'll dance it one time, that dance called the charleston, made in South Caroline
	Sometime you'll dance it one time, that dance called the charleston, made in South Caroline

CHARLIE BROWN
Fe-fe, fi-fi, fo-fo, fum, I smell smoke in the auditorium
	Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown, he's a clown, that Charlie Brown
	He's gonna get caught, just you wait and see (Why's everybody always pickin' on me)
That's him on his knees, I know that's him, yeah, yellin' "7 come 11," down in the boys' gym
	Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown, he's a clown, that Charlie Brown
	He's gonna get caught, just you wait and see (Why's everybody always pickin' on me)
    Who's always writing on the wall? Who's always goofing in the hall?
    Who's always throwing spit balls? Guess who (Who, me?) yeah, you!
Who walks in the classroom, cool and slow, who calls the English teacher, Daddy-O
	Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown, he's a clown, that Charlie Brown
	He's gonna get caught, just you wait and see (Why's everybody always pickin' on me)
YAKETY YAK, DON'T TALK BACK
Take out the papers and the trash, or you don't get no spendin' cash
If you don't scrub that kitchen floor, you ain't gonna rock and roll no more
	Yakety yak (Don't talk back)
Just finish cleanin' up your room, let's see that dust fly with that broom
Get all that garbage out of sight, or you don't go out Friday night
	Yakety yak (Don't talk back)
You just put on your coat and hat, and walk yourself to the laundromat
And when you finish doin' that, bring in the dog and put out the cat
	Yakety yak (Don't talk back)
Don't you give me no dirty looks, your father's hip, he knows what cooks
Just tell your hoodlum friend outside you ain't got time to take a ride
	Yakety yak (Don't talk back)

CHARLIE ON THE M.T.A.
Well, let me tell you of the story of a man named Charlie, on a tragic and fateful day
He put ten cents in his pocket, kissed his wife and family, went to ride on the M.T.A.
	Well, did he ever return? No, he never returned and his fate is still un-learned ("what a pity")
	He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston, he's the man who never re-turned
Charlie handed in his dime at the Kendall Square station, and he changed for Jamaica Plain
When he got there the conductor told him, "One more nickel," Charlie couldn't get off of that train
	(But) CHORUS       ("poor old Charlie")
Now, all night long Charlie rides through the station, crying, "What will become of me?
How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea, or my cousin in Roxbury?"
	(But) CHORUS
Charlie's wife goes down to the Scollay Square station, every day at quarter past two
And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich, as the train comes rumbling through
	(Well) CHORUS
Now, ye citizens of Boston, don't you think it's a scandal, how the people have to pay and pay?
Fight the fare increase, vote for George O'Brian, get poor Charlie off the M.T.A.
	Or else he'll never return, no he'll never return and his fate is still un-learned
	He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston, he's the man who never re-turned
	He's the man who never returned, he's the man who never returned!

CHARMAINE
Charmai-ai-ai-ai-ai-aine
I wonder why you keep me waiting Charmaine (my Charmaine), cries in vain (cries in vain)
I wonder, when bluebirds are mating, will you come back again
And I wonder if I keep on praying, will our dreams be the same (be the same)
I wonder if ever you think of me too,  I'm waiting, my Charmaine, for you

I wonder why you keep me waiting, Charmaine (my Charmaine), My Charmaine (my Charmaine)
I wonder, when bluebirds are mating, will you come back again
And I wonder if I keep on praying, will our dreams be the same (be the same)
I wonder if ever you think of me too,  I'm waiting, my Charmaine, for you, just for you
I'm waiting, my Charmaine, for you (Just - for - you...)

CHATTANOOGA CHOO CHOO
Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo, track 29, boy, you can give me a shine.
I can afford to board the Chattanooga Choo Choo, I've got my fare, and just a trifle to spare.
	You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
	Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
	Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer, than to have your ham and eggs in Carolina
	When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
	Then you know that Tennessee is not very far,
	Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin', woo, woo, Chattanooga there you are
There's gonna be a certain party at the station, in satin and lace, I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam
So Chattanooga Choo Choo won't you choo choo me home.

CHATTANOOGA SHOE SHINE BOY
Have you ever passed the corner of Fourth and Grand
Where a little ball of rhythm has a shoeshine stand
People gather round and they clap their hands he's a great big bundle of joy
He pops a boogie woogie rag Chattanooga shoeshine boy
Well he charges you a nickel just to shine one shoe
He makes the oldest kind of leather look like new
You feel as though you wanna dance when he gets through
He's a great big bundle of joy
He pops a boogie woogie rag Chattanooga shoeshine boy
	Well it's a wonder that the rag don't tear the way he makes it pop
	You oughta see him fan the air with his hoppity-hippity-hoppity-hippity...hop, hop, hop
He opens up for business when the clock strikes nine
He likes to get 'em early when they're feelin' fine
Everybody gets a little rise and shine with a great big bundle of joy
He pops a boogie woogie rag Chattanooga shoeshine boy
	Well it's a wonder that the rag...

CHEEK TO CHEEK
Heaven, I'm in Heaven, and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven, I'm in Heaven, and the cares that hang around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
	Oh! I love to climb a mountain and to reach the highest peak
	But it doesn't thrill me half as much as dancing cheek to cheek
	Oh! I love to go out fishing in a river or a creek
	But I don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to cheek
		Dance with me, I want my arm about you
		The charm about you will carry me through to
Heaven, I'm in Heaven, and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek, when we're out together dancing,
Out together dancing, out together dancing cheek to cheek.

CHEERS THEME
Making your way in the world today takes everything you got
Taking a break from all your worries sure would help a lot.
Wouldn't you like to  get away?
Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name
And they're always glad you came
You wanna be where you can see troubles are all the same
You wanna  be where everybody knows your name
You wanna  go where people know people are all the same
You wanna go where everybody knows your name
Climbing the walls when no one calls; you've lost at love again
And the more you're down and out, the more you need a friend
When you long to hear a kind "hello"
	(Sometimes you want to go......)

CHERRY PINK AND  APPLE BLOSSOM WHITE
It's cherry pink and apple blossom white, when your  true lover comes your way
It's cherry pink and apple blossom white, the poets say.
The story goes that once a cherry tree, beside an apple tree did grow
And there a boy once met his bride to be long long ago
	The boy looked into her eyes, it was a sight to enthrall,
	The breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall.
	And as they gently caressed, the lovers looked up to find,
	The branches of the two trees were intertwined.
And that is why the poets always write, if there's a new moon bright above
It's cherry pink and apple blossom white, when you're in love

CHICAGO
Chicago, Chicago that toddling town. Chicago, Chicago I'll show you around
I love it, bet your bottom dollar you'll lose the blues in Chicago, Chicago
The town that Billy Sunday couldn't shut down

On state street, that great street, I just want to say
They do things they don't do on Broadway
They have the time, the time of their life
I saw a man he danced with his wife in Chicago, Chicago my home town

CHILD IN ME AGAIN
I'd like to lose all time again, and look for trees to climb again
Recite a little rhyme again, and dream a reckless dream
For someone I'd exiled in me, awoke today and smiled in me
I need to find the child in me again
　　　　Oh, I know that we all grow older, grow sadder, grow wiser, grow colder, grow up
　　　　So I look for myself leaving no stone unturned
　　　　All I need to recapture the truths I've unlearned
The honesty, the open face, the simple faith and easy grace
I didn't see the time erase the child I used to be
I'll have to wait a while and see, she may come back in style in me
I need to find the child in me again
　　　　Oh I know that we all grow older, grow sadder, grow wiser, grow colder, grow up
　　　　So I look for myself leaving no stone unturned
　　　　Oh, I need to recapture the truths I've unlearned
To find myself a child again, to meet the morning mild again
To run headlong and wild again into a dawning dream
It seems like such a precious thing,  a peace beyond imaging
But Winter will give way to Spring again
　　　　
It seems like such a precious thing, a peace beyond imagining
Yet she'll awake and smile in me, and she'll be reconciled in me
I need to find the child in me again, I need to find the child in me again

CHRISTMAS ISLAND
How'd you like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd you like to spend a holiday away across the sea?
How'd you like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd you like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree?
	How'd you like to stay up late,  like the islanders do,
   Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe?
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island,
You will never stray for ev'ry day your Christmas dreams come true.
On Christmas Island, your dreams come true. (On Christmas Is -  land)

CHRISTMAS MEMORIES
Singing carols, stringing popcorn, making footprints in the snow
Memories, Christmas memories, they're the sweetest ones I know

Cookies, baking in the kitchen, cards and ribbons everywhere
Frosty, Christmas memories float like snowflakes in the air
	And oh, the joy of waking Christmas mornings, the family round the tree
	We had a way of making Christmas morning
	As merry as can be, I close my eyes and see....
Shining faces of all the children, who now have children of their own
Funny, but comes December, and I remember every Christmas I've known

THE CHRISTMAS SONG
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your nose,
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir and folds dressed up like Eskimos.
Ev'rybody knows a turkey and mistletoe help to make the season bright.
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow, will find it hard to sleep tonight.
	They know that Santa's on his way; he's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh.
	And ev'ry mother's child is gonna spy to see if reindeer really know how to fly.
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase to kids from one to ninety-two.
Although it's been said many times, many ways, "Merry Christmas to you."

CHRISTMAS TIME IS HERE
Christmas time is here. Happiness and cheer
Fun for all, that children call their favorite time of the year
Snowflakes in the air, carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes of love and dreams to share
	Sleigh bells in the air, beauty everywhere
	Yuletide by the fireside, and joyful memories there
Christmas time is here, we'll be drawing near
Oh, that we could always see such spirit through the year
Oh, that we could always see such spirit through the year...

THE CHRISTMAS WALTZ
Frosted window panes, candles gleaming inside, painted candy canes on the tree
Santa's on his way; he's filled his sleigh with things, things for you and for me
It's that time of year, when the world falls in love, every song you hear seems to say
"Merry Christmas, may your New Year dreams come true."
And this song of mine, in three-quarter time,
Wishes you and yours the same thing too.

CIELITO LINDO
De las sierras morenas, Cielito Lindo, vienen bajando
Un par de ojitos negros, Cielito lindo, de contrabando
	Ay, ay, ay, ay canta y no llores
	Porque cantando se alegran, Cielito Lindo, los corazones
Una flecha en el aire, Cielito Lindo, tiró Cupido
Él la tiró jugando, Cielito Lindo y a mí me ha herido.
De tu casa a la mía, Cielito Lindo, solo hay un paso
Ahora que estamos solos, Cielito lindo, dame un abrazo
	Ay, ay, ay, ay canta y no llores
	Porque cantando se alegran, Cielito Lindo, los corazones

THE CIRCLE GAME
Yesterday a child came out to wander. Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder, and tearful at the falling of a star

Then the child moved 10 times round the seasons. Skated over 10 clear frozen streams
Words like "when you're older" must appease him and promises of "someday" make his dreams
     And the seasons they go round and round, and the painted ponies go up and down
     We're captive on a carousel of time
     We can't return, we can only look behind from where we came
     And go 'round and 'round and 'round in the circle game.
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now,
Cartwheels turn to carwheels through the town
And they tell him,  take your time, it won't be long now
'Til you drag your feet to slow the circles down
  CHORUS
So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through.
  CHORUS

CITY OF NEW ORLEANS
Riding on the City of New Orleans, Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders, three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey the train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names, freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.
	Good morning America how are you?
	Don't you know me I'm your native son,
	I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
	I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.
Dealin' card games with the young man in the club car, penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle, feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of pullman porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel.
Mothers with their babes asleep, are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel.
	CHORUS
Nighttime on The City of New Orleans, changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning, through the Mississippi darkness, rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream, and the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again, the passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.
	Good night, America, how are you?
	Don't you know me I'm your native son,
	I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
	I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

CLEMENTINE
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling, oh, my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry, Clementine.

In a cavern, in a canyon, excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner, and his daughter, Clementine.

Oh, my darling, oh, my darling, oh, my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry, Clementine.

CLEMENTINE-"The Whole Story"
In a cavern, in a canyon, excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner, and his daughter, Clementine.
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling, oh, my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry, Clementine.
Light she was, and like a fairy, and her shoes were number nine.
Herring boxes without topses, sandals were for Clementine.

Drove she ducklings to the water every morning just at nine
Hit her foot against a splinter, fell in-to the foaming brine.
	CHORUS
Ruby lips above the water blowing bubbles soft and fine
As for me, I was no swimmer and I lost my Clementine

How I missed her, how I missed her, how I missed my Clementine.
Then I kissed her little sister and for-got dear Clementine
	CHORUS

CLOSE TO YOU
Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near
Just like me,  they long to be close to you
Why do stars fall down from the sky every time you walk by
Just like me,  they long to be close to you
	On the day that you were born the angels got together
	And decided to create a dream come true
	So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
	And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the boys in town follow you all around
Just like me,  they long to be close to you
Just like me,  they long to be close to you
Ah................................close to you,    Ah................................close to you

COAST GUARD MARCHING SONG (SEMPER PARATUS)
	From Aztec Shore to Arctic Zone, to Europe and Far East,
	The Flag is carried by our ships, in times of war and peace;
	And never have we struck it yet, in spite of foeman's might.
	Who cheered our crews and cheered again, for showing how to fight.
So here's the Coast Guard marching song, we sing on land and sea.
Through surf and storm and howling gale, high shall our purpose be.
"Semper Paratus" is our guide, our fame and glory too.
To fight to save or fight and die, aye! Coast Guard we are for you.

COCKLES AND MUSSELS (MOLLY MALONE)
In Dublin's fair city, where girls are so pretty,
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Ma-lone,
As she wheeled her wheel-barrow through streets broad and narrow,
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, a-live, alive-o!"
	"A-live, alive-o! A-live, alive-o!"
	Crying, "Cockles and mussels, a-live, alive-o!"
She was a fish-monger, but sure 'twas no wonder,
For so were her father and mother be-fore,
And they each wheeled their barrow through streets broad and narrow,
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, a-live, alive-o!"
	(CHORUS)
She died of a fever, and no one could save her.
And that was the end of sweet Molly Ma-lone,
But her ghost wheels her barrow through streets broad and narrow,
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, a-live, alive-o!"
	(CHORUS)

COLOR MY WORLD
As time goes on, I realize just what you mean to me.
And now, now that you're near, promise your love that I've waited to share
And dreams of our moments together. Color my world with hopes of loving you

COLUMBIA, THE  GEM OF THE OCEAN
Oh, Columbia, the gem of the ocean,  the home of the brave and the free
The shrine of each patriot's devotion, a world offers homage to thee.
Thy mandates make heroes assemble, when liberty's form stands in view
Thy banners make tyranny tremble, when borne by the red, white, and blue!
When borne by the red, white, and blue! When borne by the red, white, and blue!
Thy banners make tyranny tremble, when borne by the red, white, and blue!

When war winged its wide desolations, and threatened the land to deform
The ark then of freedom's foundation, Columbia rode safe through the storm
With the garlands of vict'ry about her, when so proudly she bore her brave crew
With her flag proudly floating before her, the boast of the red, white, and blue!
The boast of the red, white, and blue! The boast of the red, white, and blue!
With her flag proudly floating before her, the boast of the red, white, and blue!

The star-spangled banner bring hither, o'er Columbia's true sons let it wave
May the wreaths they have won never wither, nor its stars cease to shine on the brave
May the service united ne'er sever, but hold to their colors so true
The army and navy forever, three cheers for the red, white, and blue!
Three cheers for the red, white, and blue! Three cheers for the red, white, and blue!
The army and navy forever, three cheers for the red, white, and blue!

COME A LITTLE BIT CLOSER
In a little café just the other side of the border
She was just sitting there giving me looks that made my mouth water
So I started walking her way, she belonged to bad man José
And I knew, yes I knew I should leave, when I heard her say
	Come a little bit closer, you're my kind of man, so big and so strong
	Come a little bit closer, I'm all alone, and the night is so long
So we started to dance, in my arms she felt so inviting
That I just couldn't resist just one little kiss so exciting
Then I heard the guitar player say, "Vamoose, José's on his way!"
And I knew, yes I knew I should run, but then I heard her say
	Come a little bit closer, you're my kind of man, so big and so strong
	Come a little bit closer, I'm all alone, and the night is so long
Then the music stopped, when I looked the café was empty
Then I heard José say, "Man, you know you're in trouble plenty"
So I dropped my drink from my hand, and through the window I ran
And as I rode away I could hear her say to José
	Come a little bit closer, you're my kind of man, so big and so strong
	Come a little bit closer, I'm all alone, and the night is so long

COME AND GET IT
If you want it, here it is come and get it, mmmm, make your mind up fast
If you want it, anytime I can give it, but you better hurry, 'cause it may not last
	Did I hear you say that there must be a catch,
	Will you walk away from a fool and his money
If you want it, here it is come and get it, but you better hurry, 'cause it's going fast

If you want it, here it is come and get it, mmmm, make your mind up fast
If you want it, anytime,  I can give it, but you better hurry, 'cause it may not last
	Did I hear you say that there must be a catch, will you walk away from a fool and his money
Sonny, if you want it, here it is come and get it, but you better hurry, 'cause it's going fast
You'd better hurry, 'cause it's going fast.........fool and his money

Sonny, if you want it, here it is come and get it, but you better hurry, 'cause it's going fast
You'd better hurry, 'cause it's going fast, you'd better hurry, 'cause it's going fast

COME AND GET THESE MEMORIES
        Lover you've gone from me and left behind, so many memories.
Here's your old friendship ring, I can't wear it no more.
Here's your old love letters,  I can't read them any more.
        Lover you've gone from me and left behind, so many memories.
Here's that old teddy bear that you won for me at the state fair.
Here's some old Valentine cards, give them to your new sweetheart.
        Lover you've gone from me and left behind, so many memories.
Here's our old favorite record, I can't stand to hear it anymore.
Here's some old lingering love, it's in my heart and it's tearing it apart.
	Because of these memories, I never think of anybody but you.
	So, come on and get 'em, 'cause I found me somebody new.
Come and get these memories, since you've gone out of my life
So my heart can be at ease.  Since you've gone out of my life
Give them to your new love. Give them to your new love.

COME DANCE WITH ME
Hey there cutes, put on your dancin' boots, and come dance with me
Come dance with me, what an evening for some Terpsichore
Pretty face, I know a swingin' place, come on dance with me
Romance with me on a crowded floor
	And while the rhythm swings, what lovely things I'll be sayin'
	'Cause what is dancing, but making love set to music, playin'
When the band begins to leave the stand and folks start to roam
As we walk home, cheek to cheek we'll be
Come on, come on, come on.....come on, come on, come on.....
Come on, come on and dance with me

COME FLY WITH ME
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away!
If you can use some exotic booze, there's a bar in far  Bombay.
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away!

Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In llama land there's a one-man band, and he'll toot his flute for you.
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue
	Once I get you up there, where the air is rarified, we'll just glide, starry eyed
	Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
	You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together.
Weather-wise, it's such a lovely day.
Just say the words, and we'll beat the birds down to  Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, come fly, let's fly away!

COME GO WITH ME
Well, love, love me, darling, come and go with me.  Please don't send me way beyond the sea.
I need you, darling, so come go with me

Come, come, come, come into my heart. Tell me, darling, we will never part
I need you, darling, so come go with me
	Yes, I need you, yes, I really need you. Please say that you'll never leave me.
	Well, say you never, yes you  really never, you never give me a chance.
Come, come, come, come into my heart. Tell me, darling, we will never part
I need you, darling, so come go with me
	Yes, I need you, yes, I really need you. Please say that you'll never leave me.
	Well, say you never, yes you  really never, you never give me a chance.
Well, love, love me, darling, come and go with me.  Please don't send me way beyond the sea.
I need you, darling, so come go with me. Come on, go with me, come on, go with me

COME IN, STRANGER
She said, "Come in, stranger," it's good to have you home
I hurried thru 'cause I knew it was you, when I saw your dog, waggin' his tail
Honey, why didn't you let me know by mail, you've been gone so long

She said, "Come in, stranger," I know you're weary from all the miles
Just sit right there in your easy chair, and tell me about all the places you've been
How long it'll be before you leave again, I hope it's a long, long while

She said, "Come in, stranger," everything around home is fine
I've watched and I've waited for you to get back, and I missed you all the time

She said, "Come in, stranger," oh how I miss you when you're gone
I walk the floor and I watch the door, and then I lie awake and wonder where you can be
I'd give anything to have you here with me, I get so lonesome all alone

She said, "Come in, stranger," and won't you listen to my plea
Stay long enough, so that the one I love won't be a stranger to me   (X2)

COME MONDAY
Headin' up to San Francisco for the Labor Day weekend show.
I've  got my   hushpuppies on, I guess I never was meant for glitter rock and roll.
And, Honey I didn't know that I'd be missing you so.
	Come Monday it'll be all right. Come Monday I'll be holding you tight.
	I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A. haze and I just want you back by my side
Yes,  it's been quite a summer. Rent-a -cars and west bound trains.
And now you're off on vacation, something you tried to explain.
And, Darling it's I love you so, that's the reason I just let you go.
	Come Monday......
    I can't help it honey, you're that much a part of me now.
    Remember that night in Montana when we said there'd be no room for doubt.
I hope you're enjoying the scenery, I  know it's  pretty up there
We can go hiking on Tuesday, with you I'd walk anywhere.
California has worn me quite thin, I just can't wait to see you again.
	Come Monday......

COME RAIN OR COME SHINE
I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you, come rain or come shine
High as a mountain deep as a river, come rain or come shine
I guess when you met me it was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me, 'cause I'm gonna be true if you let me

You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me, come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together, and won't it be fine
Days may be cloudy or sunny. We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always I'm with you rain or shine

COME SATURDAY MORNING
Come Saturday morning, I'm goin' away with my friend
We'll Saturday-spend till the end of the day
Just I and my friend, we'll travel for miles in our Saturday smiles
And then we'll move on, but we will remember long after Saturday's gone

Come Saturday morning, I'm goin' away with my friend
We'll Saturday-laugh more than half of the day
Just I and my friend, dressed up in our rings and our Saturday things
And then we'll move on, but we will remember long after Saturday's gone
	Come Saturday morning....
Just I and my friend, we'll travel for miles in our Saturday smiles
And then we'll move on, but we will remember long after Saturday's gone
(Come Saturday morning, come Saturday mo-o-rning)
(Come Saturday morning, come Saturday mo-o-rning)
  FADE

COME SEE ABOUT ME
I've been cryin' (ooh, ooh), 'cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned (to tears), but tears won't wash away the fears
	That you're never ever gonna return, to ease the fire that within me burns
	It keeps me cryin', baby, for you, keeps me sighin', baby, for you
	So won't you hurry, come on, boy, see about me, (come see about me),
	See about you, baby, (come see about me)

	So come on, hurry, come on and see about me (come see about me)

	Keeps me cryin', baby, for you, keep on, keep on cryin', baby, for you

COMES LOVE
Comes a rainstorm, put your rubbers on your feet
Comes a snowstorm, you can get a little heat. Comes love, nothing can be done.
Comes a fire, then you know just what to do
Blow a tire, you can buy another shoe. Comes love, nothing can be done
	Don't try hiding, cause there isn't any use
	You'll start sliding, when your heart turns on the juice
Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day
Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away. Comes love, nothing can be done
	That's all, brother, if you've ever been in love
	That's all, brother, you know just what I'm speaking of
Comes a heatwave, you can hurry to the shore
Comes a summons, you can hide behind the door
Comes love, nothing can be done
Comes the measles, you can quarantine the room
Comes a mousey, you can chase it with a broom
Comes love, nothing can be done
	That's all, brother, if you've ever been in love
	That's all, brother, you know just what I'm speaking of
Comes a nightmare, you can always stay awake
Comes depression, you may get another break
Comes love, nothing can be done, nothing can be done, nothing can be done

CONEY ISLAND BABY/WE ALL FALL
Oh, goodbye, my Coney Island Baby, farewell, my own true love, true love
I'm gonna go away and leave you, never to see you any, never gonna see you any
I'm gonna sail upon that ferry boat, never to return again, return again
So, goodbye, farewell, so long forever,
Goodbye, my Coney Isle, goodbye, my Coney Isle,  goodbye my Coney Island

We all fall for some girl that dresses neat, some girl that's got big feet, we meet her on the street
Then we'll join the army of married boobs, to the altar, just like leading lambs to slaughter
When it's over, oh boy, we get it good, bachelor days we then recall, we then recall
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief,
Doctor, lawyer, merchant chief, we all are bound for...

Goodbye, my Coney Island Baby, farewell, my own true love, true love
I'm gonna go away and leave you, never to see you any, never gonna see you any
I'm gonna sail upon that ferry boat, never to return again, return again
So, goodbye, farewell, so long forever,
Goodbye, my Coney Isle, goodbye, my Coney Isle,  goodbye my Coney Island,
Bye, my Coney Island Babe!

CONEY ISLAND WASHBOARD
Down by the beach lived the sweetest little peach
And I must say she just had the cutest way
Playing a chord up-on a wash-board
The folks would gather 'round, from everywhere in town, just to hear her play.
Coney Island washboard she would play
You could hear her on the boardwalk every day
Soap suds all around, little bubbles on the ground
Rub-a-dub-a-dub in her little tub, all those  tunes she found
Little thimbles on her fingers made the noise
She played "Charleston" on the laundry for the boys
She could rag a tune right through the knees of  a brand new pair of blue denim jeans
Oh Coney Island washboard roundelay.

CONSIDER YOURSELF
Consider yourself at home
Consider yourself one of the family
We've taken to you so strong
It's clear we're going to get along
Consider yourself well in
Consider yourself part of the furniture
There isn't a lot to spare
Who cares, whatever we've got we share
	If it should chance to be we should see some harder days
	Empty larder days, why grouse
	Always a chance to meet somebody to foot the bill
	Then the drinks are on the house
Consider yourself our mate
We don't want to have no fuss
For after some consideration we can state
Consider yourself one of us

COQUETTE
Tell me, why you keep fooling, Little Coquette, makin' fun of the one who loves you
Breakin' hearts you are ruling, Little Coquette, true hearts tenderly dreaming of you.
	Someday you'll fall in love like I fell in love with you.
	Maybe someone you love will just be foolin'
	And when you're all alone with only regrets,
	You know, Little Coquette, I love you.
Someday you'll fall in love like I fell in love with you.
Maybe someone you love will just be foolin'
And when you're all alone with only regrets,
You know, Little Coquette, I love you.
You know, Little Coquette, I love you.

CORNER OF THE SKY
Everything has its season, everything has its time.
Show me a reason, and I'll soon show you a rhyme.
Cats fit on the windowsill, children fit in the snow.
Why do I feel  I don't fit in anywhere I go?
	Rivers belong where they can ramble, eagles belong where they can fly
	I've got to be where my spirit can run free, gotta find my corner of the sky.
Every man has his daydreams, every man has his goal
People like the way dreams have of sticking to the soul
Thunderclouds have their lightning, nightingales have their song
And don't you see I want my life to be something more than long
	Rivers belong.....
So many men seem destined to settle for something small
But I won't rest until I know I'll have it all
So don't ask  where I'm going, just listen when I'm gone
And far away you'll hear me singing softly to the dawn:
	Rivers belong.....

A COTTAGE FOR SALE
Our little dream castle with every dream gone
Is lonely and silent, the  shades are all drawn
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon a cottage for sale
The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay
Our beautiful garden has withered away
Where you planted roses, the weeds seem to say a cottage for sale
	From every single window I see your face,
	But when I reach a window there's empty space
The key in the mailbox, the same as before
But no one is waiting for me anymore
The end of our story is told on the door, a cottage for sale
	A cottage built for me and you will never be a dream come true
	The leaves are on the ground, everything is down, it's a cottage for sale.


COULD I HAVE THIS DANCE
I'll always remember the song they were playing, the first time we danced and I knew
As we swayed to the music and held to each other, I fell in love with you.
	Could I have this dance for the rest of my life?
	Would you be my partner every night?
	When we're together it feels so right could I have this dance
	For the rest of my life?
I'll always remember that magic moment when I held you close to me
As we moved together I  knew forever you're all I'll ever need
	Could I have this dance.....

COULD IT BE I'M FALLING IN LOVE
            Since I met you, I've begun to feel so strange, every time I speak your name
  You say that you are so helpless too, that you don't know what to do
          Each night I pray there will never come a day when you up and take your love away
  Say you feel the same way too, and I wonder what it is I feel for you
	Could it be I'm falling in love, could it be I'm falling in love
	Could it be I'm falling in love with you, with you  with you, with you
           I don't need all those things that used to bring me joy, you made me such a happy boy
And, honey, you'll always be the only one for me, meeting you was my destiny
            You can be sure I will never let you down, when you need me I will be around
And, darling, you'll always be the only one for me, heaven made you specially
	Could it be I'm falling in love, could it be I'm falling in love
	Could it be I'm falling in love with you, with you  with you, with you
And, darling, you'll always be the only one for me, heaven made you specially
	Could it be I'm falling in love, could it be I'm falling in love
	Could it be I'm falling in love with you, with you  with you, with you
	   With you.............  with you

COULD 'JA
Could'ya, for an ice cream sundae? Could'ya, for a smile or two?
Would'ya, say, along about next Monday, keep a guy from feeling blue?
Could'ya, for big a red apple? Could'ya, for a tootsie roll?
Would'ya, for some Philadelphia truffle, brighten up a lonely soul?
	I don't wanna have the stars in my pocket, or ride a rocket to the moon.
	I just want what I want when I see what I want, and I hope that I get it soon.
Oh, Could'ya, for a peaceful valley? Could'ya, for a Brooklyn Tree?
Would'ya, for a honeymoon in Bali? Could'ya fall in love with me?

Could'ya, for a peaceful valley? Could'ya, for the Zuyder Zee?
Would'ya, for a honeymoon in Bali? Could you fall in love with me?
Could you fall in love with me? Could you fall in love with me?
I know you could, I wish you would. Could you fall in love with me?

COULD THIS BE MAGIC
Could this be magic, my dear, my heart's all aglow. Could this be magic, loving you so
Could this be magic, my dear, having your love? My prayers were answered so far from above
	I thought it would be just a memory, to linger my heart in pain
	But too much pride, I opened up my eyes, and I'm with you, dear, once again
Could this be magic, my dear, having your love
If this is magic, then magic is mine, could this be magic, then magic is mine

COUNTIN' FLOWERS ON THE WALL
I keep hearin' you're concerned about my happiness
But all that thought you're givin' me is conscience, I guess
If I was walkin' in your shoes I wouldn't worry none
While you and your friends are worryin' about me, I'm havin' lots of fun
	Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
	Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
	Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo. Now don't tell me I've nothin' to do
Last night I dressed in tails, pretended I was on the town
As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doin' fine
You can always find me here and havin' quite a time
	Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
	Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
	Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo. Now don't tell me I've nothin' to do
It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright
Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete
	Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
	Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
	Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo. Now don't tell me I've nothin' to do
	Don't tell me I've nothin' to do

COUNTRY ROAD
Take to the highway, won't you lend me your name
Your way and my way seem to be one and the same
	Momma don't understand it, she wants to know where I've been
	I'd have to be some  kind of natural born fool to want to pass that way again
	But you know I could feel it, on a country road
Sail on home to Jesus, won't you, good girls and boys
I'm all in pieces, you can have your own choice
	But I can see a heavenly band of angels, and they're comin' to set me free
	I don't know nothin' 'bout the wild wind, but I can tell you that it's bound to be
	Because I could feel it, on a country road
     I guess my feet know where they want me to go, walkin' down a country road
    Walk on down, walk on down, walk on down

COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS
When I'm worried and I can't sleep, I count my blessings instead of sheep
And I  fall asleep, counting my blessings.
When my bankroll is getting small, I think of when I had none at all
And I fall asleep, counting my blessings.
	I think about a nursery and I picture curly heads
	And one by one I count them as they slumber in their beds.
If you're worried and you can't sleep, just count your blessings instead of sheep
And you'll fall asleep, counting your blessings.

CRACKLIN' ROSIE
Cracklin' Rosie get on board. We're gonna ride till there ain't no more to go
Takin' it slow, Lord, don't you know, have me a time with a poor man's lady

Hitchin' on a twilight train. Ain't nothin' here that I care to take a-long
Maybe a song, to sing when I want. Don't need to say please to no man for a happy tune
     Oh, I love my Rosie child, you got the way to make me happy. You and me, we go in style
     Cracklin' Rosie, you're a store-bought woman, you make me sing like a guitar hummin'
     So hang on to me, girl, our song keeps runnin' on. Play it now, play it now, play it now, my baby
Cracklin' Rosie, make me a smile. Girl, if it lasts for an hour, that's al-right
We got all night, to set the world right. Find us a dream that don't ask no questions, yeah!
     Oh, I love my Rosie child, you got the way to make me happy. You and me, we go in style
     Cracklin' Rosie, you're a store-bought woman, you make me sing like a guitar hummin'
     So hang on to me, girl, our song keeps runnin' on. Play it now, play it now, play it now, my baby
Cracklin' Rosie, make me a smile. Girl, if it lasts for an hour, that's al-right
We got all night, to set the world right. Find us a dream that don't ask no questions,

CRAZY
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely, I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue
I knew that you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then some day you'd leave me for somebody new
	Worry, why do I let myself worry, wondering what in the world did I do
	I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
	I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying, and I'm crazy for loving you

CRAZY LITTLE THING CALLED LOVE
This thing called love, I just can't handle it, this thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready, crazy little thing called love
This called love it, cries in a cradle all night. It swings, it jives, it shakes all over like a jelly-fish
I kinda like it, crazy little thing called love
	There goes my baby, she knows how to rock n' roll, she drives me crazy
	She gives me hot and cold fever, then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat
I gotta be cool relax, get hip, get on my track
Take a back seat, hitch-hike, and take a long ride on my motor bike
'Til I'm ready, crazy little thing called love

CRAZY LOVE
I can hear her heart beatin', from a thousand miles
Yeah, and her hair runs open, every time she smiles
And when I come to her, that's where I belong
Yeah, and I run into her like a river song
	She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
	She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She got a fine sense of humor, when I'm feelin' low-down
Yeah, when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my troubles, take away my grief,
Take away my heartache, you know, in the night, like a thief
	She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
	She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
     Yeah, and I need her in the daytime, yeah, and I need her in the night
     Yeah, and I want to throw my arms around her, and kiss and hug her, kiss and hug her tight
Yeah, when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin', brighten up my day
Yeah, and it makes me righteous, yeah, and it makes me whole
Yeah, and it makes me mellow, down to my soul
	She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
	She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love   (repeat refrain)

CRAZY LOVE-Poco
Tonight I'm gonna break away, just you wait and see
I'll never be imprisoned by a faded memory

Just when I think I'm over her, this broken heart will mend
I hear her name, and I have to cry, the tears come down again
	It happens all the time, this crazy love of mine
	Wraps around my heart,  refusin' to unwind
	Ooh-hoo, crazy love, ah ha
Count the stars in a summer sky, that fall without a sound
And then pretend that you can't hear, these teardrops comin' down
	It happens all the time, this crazy love of mine
	Wraps around my heart,  refusin' to unwind
	Ooh-hoo, crazy love, ah ha
Tonight I'm gonna break away, just you wait and see
I'll never be imprisoned by a faded memory
	It happens all the time, this crazy love of mine
	Wraps around my heart,  refusin' to unwind
	Ooh-hoo, crazy love, ah ha
Tonight I'm gonna break away

CRAZY RHYTHM
Crazy rhythm, here's the doorway, I'll go my way, you'll go your way
Crazy rhythm, from now on we're through
Here is where we have a showdown, I'm too high-hat, you're too low-down
Crazy rhythm, here's goodbye to you!
	They say that when a high-brow meets a low-brow walkin' along Broadway
	Soon the high-brow, he has no-brow, ain't it a shame? And you're to blame.
What's the use of prohibition? You produce the same condition.
Crazy rhythm, from now on we're through. Crazy rhythm, I've gone crazy too!

CRAZY SHE CALLS ME
I say I'll move the mountains, and I'll move the mountains, if she wants them out of the way
Crazy she calls me. Sure, I'm crazy,  crazy in love, I say.
I say I'll go through fire, and I'll go through fire.  As she wants it, so it will be
Crazy she calls  me. Sure, I'm crazy,  Crazy in love, you see.
	Like the wind that shakes the bough, she moves me with a smile
    	The difficult, I'll do right now. The impossible will take a little while
I say I'll care forever, and I mean forever,  if I have to hold up the sky;
Crazy she calls me.  Sure, I'm crazy, crazy in love am I, crazy in love am I

CROCODILE ROCK
     La, la, la, la, la, la, etc.
I remember when rock was young, me and Susie had so much fun
Holdin' hands and skimmin' stones, had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got was doin' a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While other kids were rockin' round the clock
We were hoppin' and boppin' to the Crocodile Rock, well
	Crocodile Rockin' is something shocking when your feet just can't keep still
	I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
	Lordy mama, those Friday nights when Susie wore her dresses tight
	And Crocodile Rockin' was ou—ou—out of sigh-i-i-i-t.
     La, la la la la la, la, etc.
But the years went by and rock just died, Susie went and left me for some foreign guy
Long nights cryin' by the record machine,
Dreamin' 'bout my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we got burnin' up to the crocodile rock
Learnin' fast as weeks went past, we really thought the Crocodile Rock would last well,
   	Crocodile Rockin' is something shocking.......
     La, la la la la la, la, la, etc.

CROOKED HIGHWAY
If today was not a crooked highway, If tonight I could finally stand tall,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time, lonesome would mean nothin' to me at all.
	Only if my own true love was waitin', and if I could hear her heart softly poundin'
	Only if she was lying by me, I'd lie in my bed once again.
I can't see my reflection in the water, can't speak the sounds that know no pain,
Can't hear the echo of my footsteps, don't remember the sound of my own name.
	Only if my own true love was waitin', and if I could hear her heart softly poundin'
	Only if she was lying by me, I'd lie in my bed once again.
There's beauty in the silver, singin' river. There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky.
But none of these and nothin' else can match the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
	Only if my own true love was waitin', and if I could hear her heart softly poundin',
	Only if she was lying by me, I'd lie in my bed once again.
	Only if she was lying be me, I'd lie in my bed once again.

CRUISING DOWN THE RIVER
Cruising down the river on a Sunday afternoon,
With one you love, the sun above waiting for the moon.
The old accordian playing a sentimental tune,
Cruising down the river on a Sunday afternoon.
	The birds above all sing of love, a gentle sweet refrain;
	The winds around all make a sound like softly falling rain.
Just two of us together, we'll plan a honeymoon
Cruising down the river on a Sunday afternoon.
IN MY MERRY OLDSMOBILE
Come away with me, Lucile, in my merry Oldsmobile
Down the road of life we'll fly, automo-bubbling, you and I.
To the church we'll swiftly steal, then our wedding bells will peal,
You can go as far you like with me, in my merry Oldsmobile.
IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME
In the good old summertime, in the good old summer-time
Strolling through the shady lanes with your baby mine.
You hold her hand and she holds yours and that's a very good sign
That she's your tootsie-wootsie in the good old summertime.

CRYING
I was alright for a while, I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight, as you stopped to say, "Hello"
Oh, you wished me well, you couldn't tell that I've been crying over you, crying over you
Then you said, "So long," left me standing all alone, alone and crying, crying, crying, crying
It's hard to understand, but the touch of your hand can start me crying

I thought that I was over you, but it's true, so true
I love you even more than I did before, but, darling, what can I do?
For you don't love me, and I'll always be crying over you, crying over you
Yes, now you're gone, and, from this moment on, I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying,
Crying, crying, over you

CRYIN' IN THE RAIN
I'll never let you see the way my broken heart is hurtin' me
I've got my pride, and I know how to hide all my sorrow and pain
     I'll do my cryin' in the rain
If I wait for cloudy skies, you won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so, though the heartaches remain
     I'll do my cryin' in the rain
	Raindrops  fallin' from heaven could never wash away my misery
	But, since we're not together, I look for stormy weather,
	To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
Someday, when my cryin's done, I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool, but 'til then, darling, you'll never see me complain
      I'll do my cryin' in the rain, I'll do my cryin' in the rain, I'll do my cryin' in the rain.

CRYIN' TIME
Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me, I can see that far away look in your eye.
I can tell by the way you held me, darling, that it won't be long before it's crying time

Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder,
And the tears are only rain to make love grow,
Well, my love for you could never grow no stronger, if I live to be a hundred years old.

CRY ME A RIVER
Now you say you're lonely, you cry the long night thru;
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river, I cried a river over you.
Now you say you're sorry for bein' so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river, I cried a river over you.
	You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
	While you never shed a tear
	Remember? I remember all that you said;
	Told me love was too plebian, told me you were through with me an'
Now you say you love me, well just to prove you do
Come on an' cry me a river, cry me a river, I cried a river over you.

CRYSTAL CHANDELIERS
Oh the crystal chandeliers light up the paintings on your wall
The marble statuettes are standing stately in the hall
But will the timely crowd that has you laughing loud help you dry your tears
When the new wears off of your crystal chandeliers

I never did fit in too well with the folks you knew
And it's plain to see that the likes of me don't fit with you
So you traded me for the gaiety of the well to do
And you turned away from the love I offered you
Oh the crystal chandeliers...

I see your picture in the news most every day
You're the chosen girl of the social world so the stories say
But a paper smile only lasts a while then it fades away
And the love we knew will come home to you some day
Oh the crystal chandeliers...
When the new wears off of your crystal chandeliers

CUANDO CALIENTA EL SOL/LOVE ME WITH ALL OF YOUR HEART
Cuando calienta el sol aquí en la playa, siento tu cuerpo vibrar cerca de mi
Es tu palpitar, es tu cara, es tu pelo, son tus besos, me estremezco, oh, oh, oh!
Cuando calienta el sol, cuando calienta el sol

Love me with all of your heart, that's all I want, love. Love me with all of your heart, or not at all.
Just promise me this, that you'll give me all your kisses, every winter, every summer, every fall...

When we are far apart or when you're near me, love me with all of your heart as I love you
Don't give me your love for a moment or an hour, love me always as you've loved me from the start
With every beat of your heart, with every beat of your heart!

CUPID
     Cupid, draw back your bow, and let your arrow go straight to my lover's heart for me, for me
     Cupid, please hear my cry, and let your arrow fly straight to my lover's heart for me
Now, I don't mean to bother you, but I'm in distress
There's danger of me losin' all of my happiness
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist, and this you can fix, so...  (CHORUS)

Now, Cupid, if your arrow makes her love strong for me,
I promise I will love her until eternity
I know, between the two of us, her heart we can steal, help me if you will, so...   (CHORUS)
     Now, Cupid, don't you hear me calling you? I need you, Cupid, help me!

DADDY'S HOME
You're my love, you're my angel, you're the girl of my dreams
I'd like to thank you, for waiting patiently
	Daddy's home, daddy's home to stay
How I've waited for this moment, to be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me, you had teardrops in your eyes
	Daddy's home, daddy's home to stay
　　　　	 It wasn't on a Sunday (Monday and Tuesday went by)
　　　　	 It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon (all I could do was cry)
　　　　	 But I made a promise that you treasure, I made it back home to you
How I've waited for this moment, to be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me, you had teardrops in your eyes
	Daddy's home, daddy's home to stay
	Daddy's home to stay....I'm not a thousand miles away

DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL
You're the end of the rainbow, my pot of gold, you're daddy's little girl to have and hold.
A precious gem is what you are, you're mommy's bright and shining star.
You're the spirit of Christmas, the star on the tree, you're the Easter Bunny for mommy and me;
You're sugar, you're spice, you're everything nice, and you're daddy's little girl.

DA DOO RON RON
Met him on a Monday, and my heart stood still, da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Somebody told me that his name was Bill, da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
	Yeah, my heart stood still, yes, and his name was Bill
	And, when he walked me home, da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
He knew what he was doin' when he caught my eye, da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
He looked so quiet, but my, oh my, da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
	Yes, he caught my eye, yes, oh my, oh my
	And, when he walked me home, da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
He picked me up at seven, and he looked so fine, 	da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Someday soon I'm gonna make him mine, da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
	Yeah, he looked so fine, yes, I'll make him mine
	And, when he walked me home, da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
     Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah..................

DAISY BELL (BICYCLE BUILT FOR TWO)-1892
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do.   I'm half crazy, all for the love of you.
It won't be a stylish marriage, I can't afford a carriage.
But you'll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two.
THE BAND PLAYED ON-1895
Casey would waltz with the strawberry blond, and the band played on.
He'd glide 'cross the floor with the girl he adored, and the band played on.
But his brain was so loaded, it nearly exploded, the poor girl would shake with  alarm.
He'd ne'er leave the girl with the strawberry curl, and the band played on.
SCHOOL DAYS-1907
School days, school days, dear old golden rule  days
Reading and writing and 'rithmetic, taught to the tune of the hickory stick.
You were my queen in calico,  I was your bashful, barefoot beau,
And you wrote on my slate, "I love you so," when we were a couple of kids.
YOU TELL ME YOUR DREAM-1908
You had a dream, well, I had one too.  I know mine's best 'cause it was of you.
Come, sweetheart, tell me, now is the time. You tell me your dream, I'll tell you mine   (X2)

DANCE WITH ME
Dance with me, I want to be your partner. Can't you see the music is just starting?
Night is falling, and I am falling, dance with me

Fantasy could never be so giving, I feel free, I hope that you are willing
Pick the beat up, and kick your feet up, dance with me
	Let it lift you off the ground, starry eyes, and love is all around us
	I can take you where you want to go
Dance with me, I want to be your partner. Can't you see the music is just starting?
Night is falling, and I am falling, dance with me
	Let it lift you off the ground, starry eyes, and love is all around us
	I can take you where you want to go
Dance with me, I want to be your partner. Can't you see the music is just starting?
Night is falling, and I am falling, dance with me

DANCE WITH WHO BRUNG YOU
You got to dance with who brung you, swing with who swung you. Don't be a fickle fool
You came here with a gal, who has always been your pal,
Don't ya leave her for the first un-attached girl, it just ain't cool
You got to dance with who brung you, swing with who swung you. Life ain't no forty-yard dash
Be in it for the long run, in the long run you'll have more fun
If you dance with who brung you to the bash
	I had a friend named Texas,  really had some style,
	He sang good old Western Swing, and drove 'em wild, wild, wild
	Well, a talent scout from Vegas said "Boy, dress and sing this way"
	And in one short year he was broke, and in L.A.
You got to dance with who brung you,    swing with who swung you. Life ain't no forty-yard dash
Be in it for the long run, 'cause in the long run you'll have more fun
If you dance with who brung you to the bash
	You gotta be real careful what you wish for,
	'Cause you just might get the whole darn thing
	Be sure what you want is really something you can use
	Or you might wind up out there, singing the Blues
You got to dance with who brung you,    swing with who swung you. Life ain't no forty-yard dash
Be in it for the long run, in the long run you'll have more fun
If you dance with who brung you, swing with who swung you,
If you dance with who brung you to the bash

It's an invitation across the nation, a chance for folks to meet
There'll be laughin', singin', and music swingin', dancin' in the street
Philadelphia, PA, Baltimore and D.C. now, can't forget the Motor City
	All we need is music, sweet music, there'll be music everywhere
	There'll be swingin' and swayin', and records playin', dancin' in the street
	Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear, just as long as you are there
	So, come on, every guy, grab a girl, everywhere around the world,
They're dancin', they're dancin' in the street
Way down in L.A., every day, they're dancin' in the street
Let's form a big, long line, get in time, we're dancin' in the street
Across the ocean, blue, me and you, dancin' in the street.

DANCIN' ON DADDY'S SHOES
There's nothing else I'd rather do than to sit around and talk to you
And remi-nisce a-bout a simpler time
The music that we made was simple but it stayed in my memory, and on my mind
　　　　Dancin' on daddy's shoes, dancin' all around the room
　　　　Rollin' the rug up, kickin' our heels up, dancin' away the blues
　　　　Sister would clap along, everyone would sing a song
　　　　Playin' homemade music, dancin' on daddy's shoes
There's something 'bout this musty room that makes me reel, makes me swoon
That strange perfume is one of a kind
The rhythm takes me back, when I hear that razzma-tazz
There's no nicer feeling that I can find
Dancin' on daddy's shoes, memories you'll never lose, dancin' away the blues
Dancin' on daddy's shoes, dancin' all around the room,
Senti-mental memories, dancin' on daddy' shoes
Senti-mental memories, dancin' on daddy' shoes

DANCING IN THE DARK
Dancing in the dark..... till the tune ends
We're dancing in the dark....and it soon ends
We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here.
Time hurries by, we're here....and gone
Looking for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night,      I have you love
And we can face the music together, dancing in the dark

DANCIN' IN THE MOONLIGHT
We get it on most every night, when that moon is big and bright
It's a supernatural delight, everybody's dancing in the moonlight

Everybody here is out of sight, they don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose they keep it tight, everybody's dancing in the moonlight
	Dancing in the moonlight, everybody's feeling warm and bright
	It's such a fine and natural sight, everybody's dancing in the moonlight
We like our fun and we never fight, you can't dance and stay uptight
It's a supernatural delight, everybody was dancing in the moonlight
	Dancing in the moonlight, everybody's feeling warm and bright
	It's such a fine and natural sight, everybody's dancing in the moonlight
We get it on most every night, when that moon is big and bright
It's a supernatural delight, everybody's dancing in the moonlight
	Dancing in the moonlight, everybody's feeling warm and bright
	It's such a fine and natural sight, everybody's dancing in the moonlight

DANIEL
Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane,  I can see the red tail lights headin' for Spain
Oh and I can see Daniel wavin' good-bye
God, it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds  in my eyes

They say Spain is pretty though I've never been. Well Daniel says it's the best place he's ever seen
Oh and he should know, he's been there enough. Lord I miss Daniel, oh I miss  him so much, oh,
      Daniel, my brother, you are older than me, do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal
      Your eyes have died but you see more than I. Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky

DANNY BOY
O Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling, from glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the flowers are dying, 'tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow, rr when the valley's hushed and white with snow
'Tis I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow, O Danny Boy, o Danny Boy, I love you so.

DANNY BOY-key change
O Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling, from glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the flowers are dying, 'tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide
   But come ye back when summer's in the meadow, rr when the valley's hushed and white with snow
   'Tis I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow, O Danny Boy, o Danny Boy, I love you so.

But when you come, and all the flowers are dying, if I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying, and kneel, and say an Ave there for me
And I shall hear you softly tread above me, and all my grave will warmer, sweeter be
For you will bend, and tell me that you love me, and I shall sleep in peace, until you come to me
For you will bend, and tell me that you love me, oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so

DANNY'S SONG
People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one, and we've just begun, think I'm gonna have a son.
He will be like she and me, as free as a dove, conceived in love, the sun is gonna shine above.
	And even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with you, honey,
	Everything will bring a chain of love.
	And in the morning when I rise, you bring a tear of joy to my eyes,
	And tell me everything is gonna be alright.
Seems as though a month ago I beta chi, I never got high, oh, I was a sorry guy.
And now I smile and face a girl who shares my name,
Now I'm through with the game, this boy'll never be the same.
	CHORUS
Pisces, Virgo rising is a very good sign, strong and kind,  and the little boy is mine.
Now I see a family where there once was none, now we've just begun, yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun.
	CHORUS
Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup, c'mon and drink it up,
Love her and she'll bring you luck.
And if you find she helps your mind, better take her home,
Don't you live alone, try to earn what lovers own.
	CHORUS

DARK AS A DUNGEON
Come all you young fellas, so fair and so fine, and seek not your fortune in the dark, dreary mine.
It will form as a habit and seep in your soul till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
	Well it's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew
	Where the dangers are double and the pleasures are few
	Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
	Well it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines
It's many a man I have known in my day, who lived just to labor his whole life away
Like a fiend with his dope or a drunkard his wine, a man will have lust for the lure of the mine
	Well it's dark....
I hope when I die and the ages shall roll, my body will blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that's diggin' my bones
	Well it's dark....

DARK EYES
Gypsy love of mine, is there ne'er a sign, on your path to show the way that I must go?
Gone are joys I knew, they all went with you, what is left to me is just a memory.

Eyes that haunt me so, eyes that taunt me so, while they smiled at me, life was ecstasy!
Was our whirling dance just a gay romance? Or for me, perchance, just a broken dream?

Eyes of destiny, while you beckon me, I must follow still, over plain and hill.
Love, where'er I be, I shall always see stars of hope for me, your dark eyes!
Love, where'er I be, I shall always see stars of hope for me, your dark eyes!

DARK TOWN STRUTTERS' BALL
I'll  be down to get you in a taxi, honey.
You better be ready 'bout half past eight.
Now, honey, don't be late, I want to be there when the band starts playin'
Remember when we get there, honey
The two-steps, I'm gonna have 'em all
Gonna dance out both of our shoes when they play those jellyroll blues
Tomorrow night at the Dark Town Strutters' Ball

DARLING, JE VOUS AIME BEAUCOUP
Darling, je vous aime beaucoup. Je ne sais pas what to do
You know you've completely stolen my heart
Morning, noon and nighttime too, toujours, wondering what you do
That's the way I've felt, right from the start
	Ah, Cherie, my love for you is tres, tres fort
	Wish my French were good enough, I'd tell you so much more
But I hope that you compris all the things you mean to me
Darling, je vous aime beaucoup, I love you, yes I do

A DATE WITH YOU
I want a date with you, a sweet rendezvous.
A place to share with you, that makes me blue
I want to dance, to sway, and fly tonight away.

I want to kiss your lips, and never say goodbye.
A sweet romantic bliss, and make you smile.
I want a song to play, and hear your love is here to stay.
	Just you and me under lovin' moonlight, together dancing, up all night
	The warmth of your body against my heart, dancing together, forever
I want a kiss with you, a sweet rendezvous.
A place to share with you, that makes me blue
I want a song to play, and hear your love is here to stay.

DAYBREAK
Singin' to the world, it's time we let the spirit come in, let it come on in
I'm singin' to the world, everybody's caught in the spin, look at where we've been
We've been runnin' around, year after year, blinded with pride, blinded with fear
     But it's daybreak, if you want to believe, it can be daybreak, ain't no time to grieve
     Said it's daybreak, if you'll only believe, and let it shine, shine, shine
    All around the world  ((sing it to the world, sing it, sing it))
Singin' to the world, what's the point in puttin' it down? There's so much love to share
I'm singin' to the world, don't you see it all comes around? The feeling's everywhere
We've been closin' our eyes, day after day, covered in clouds, losin' our way
　　　　Hey, but it's daybreak, if you want to believe, it can be daybreak, ain't no time to grieve
	Said it's daybreak, if you'll only believe, and let it shine, shine, shine
	All around the world (gotta sing, sing it to the world, everyone singing, sing it to the world)
Yes, and it's daybreak.........

DAYDREAM
What a day for a daydream, what a day for a day-dreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy
	And even if time ain't really on my side, it's one of those days for takin' a walk outside
	I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun
	And fall on my face on somebody's new-mowed lawn
I've been having a sweet dream, I've been dreaming since I woke up today
It's starring me and my sweet thing, 'cause she's the one who makes me feel this way.
	And even if time is passing me by a lot, I couldn't care less about the dues you say I got
	Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping my load,
  	A pie in the face for being a sleepy bull toad.  (Whistle a verse)
	And you can be sure if you're feelin' right, a daydream will last a-long into the night
	Tomorrow at breakfast you make prick up your ears
	Or you may be dreamin' for a thousand years
What a day for a daydream, custom made for a day-dreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream, dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy. (Whistle a verse)

DAYDREAM BELIEVER
Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and I rise, wipe the sleep out of my eyes
My shaving razor's cold, and it stings
	Cheer up, sleepy Jean, oh, what can it mean to a
	 Daydream believer and a homecoming queen
You once thought of me as a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, and our good times start and end, without dollar one to spend
But how much, baby, do we really need

DAYENU
Ilu hotzi, hotzianu, hotzianu miMitzrayim
miMitzrayim Hotzianu day -e- nu.
	Day, day, yenu,  Day, day, yenu,  Day, day, yenu
	Dayenu dayenu.  (repeat)
Ilu natan natan lanu, natan lanu et haShabbat
et haShabbat Natan lanu day- e- nu.
            Chorus
Ilu natan natan lanu, natan lanu et haTorah
et haTorah Natan lanu day-e- nu.
	Chorus

A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A FOOL
A day in the life of a fool. A sad and a long, lonely day.
I walk the avenue, hoping I'll run into, the welcome sight of you coming my way.

I stop just across from your door, but you're never home any-more.
So back to my room, there in the gloom, I cry tears of good-bye.
  	'Til you come back to me, that's the way it will be,
	Every day in the life of a fool.

THE DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES
The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
Through a meadow land toward a closing door
A door marked "nevermore" that wasn't there before

The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you
The days of wine and roses and you

THE DAY THAT THE RAINS CAME DOWN
The day that the rains came down, Mother Earth smiled again
Now the lilacs could bloom, now the fields could grow greener
The day that the rains came down, buds were born, love was born
As the young buds will grow, so our young love will grow. Love, sweet love.
	A robin sang a song of love, a willow tree reached up to the heavens
	As if to thank the sky above, for all that rain, that welcome rain
	We looked across the meadowland, and seemed to sense a kind of a miracle
	Much too deep to understand, and there we were, so much in love
The day that the rains came down, mountain streams swelled with pride
Gone the dry river bed, gone the dust from the valley
The day that the rains came down, buds were born, love was born
As the young buds will grow, so our young love will grow. Love, sweet love, love, sweet love.

Le jour où la pluie viendra, nous serons, toi et moi
Les plus riches du monde, les plus riches du monde
Les arbres, pleurant de joie, offriront dans leurs bras
Les plus beaux fruits du monde, les plus beaux fruits du monde, ce jour-là
	La triste, triste terre rouge, qui craque, craque à l'infini
	Les branches nues que rien ne bouge, se gorgeront de pluie, de pluie
	Et le blé roulera par vagues au fond de greniers endormis
	Et je t'enroulerai de bagues, et de colliers jolis, jolis
Le jour où la pluie viendra, nous serons, toi et moi
Les fiancés du monde, les plus riches du monde
Les arbres, pleurant de joie, offriront dans leurs bras
Les plus beaux fruits du monde, les plus beaux fruits du monde, ce jour-là, ce jour-là

DECEMBER, 1963 (OH, WHAT A NIGHT)
Oh, what a night! Late December, back in '63
What a very special time for me. As I remember, what a night

Oh, what a night! You know, I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same. What a lady, what a night
	Oh, I, I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
	And, my, as I recall, it ended much too soon
Oh, what a night! Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be. Sweet surrender, what a night
     And I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
     Spinning my head around, and taking my body under
     Oh, what a night!
	Oh, I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
	And, my, as I recall, it ended much too soon.
Oh, what a night! Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right. What a lady, what a night
	Oh, I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
	Spinning my head around and taking my body under
Oh, what a night (Do do do do do, do do do do)  X3  Oh, what a night!

DECK THE HALL
Deck the hall with boughs of holly, fa la la la la la la la la
'Tis the season to be jolly, fa la la la la la la la la
Don we now our gay appar-el, fa la la la la la la la la
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol, fa la la la la la la la la

See the blazing Yule before us, fa la la la la la la la la
Strike the harp and join the chorus, fa la la la la la la la la
Follow me in merry measure, fa la la la la la la la la
While I tell of Yuletide treasure, fa la la la la la la la la

Fast away the old year passes, fa la la la la la la la la
Hail the new, ye lads and lasses, fa la la la la la la la la
Sing we joyous all together, fa la la la la la la la la
Heedless of the wind and weather, fa la la la la la la la la

DEDICATED TO YOU
If I should write a book for you, that brought me fame and fortune too
That book would be like my heart and me, dedicated to you
And if I should paint a picture too, that showed the loveliness of you
My art would be like my heart and me, dedicated to you
	To you because your love is the beacon that lights up my way
	To you because with you I know a lifetime could be just one heavenly day
If I should find a twinkling star, one half so wondrous as you are
That star would be like my heart and me, dedicated to you

'DEED I DO
Do I want you? Oh my, do I? Honey, 'Deed I Do!
Do I need you? Oh my, do I? Honey, 'Deed I Do!
I'm glad that I'm the one who found you
That's why I'm always hangin' 'round you.
Do I love you? Oh my, do I? Honey, 'Deed I...
Honey, 'Deed I...Honey, 'Deed I ...Honey, 'Deed I Do!

DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS
The stars at night are big and bright, Deep in the heart of Texas
The prairie sky is wide and high, Deep in the heart of Texas
	The sage in bloom is like perfume, Deep in the heart of Texas
	Reminds me of the one that I love, Deep in the heart of Texas
The coyotes wail along the trail, Deep in the heart of Texas
The rabbits rush around the brush, Deep in the heart of Texas
	The cowboys cry, "Ki yippee yi!" Deep in the heart of Texas
	The dogies bawl and bawl and bawl, Deep in the heart of Texas

DEEP PURPLE
	The sun is sinking low behind the hill. I loved you long ago, I love you still.
	Across the years you come to me at twilight, to bring my love's old thrill.
When the deep purple falls, over sleepy garden walls, and the stars begin to flicker in the sky
Through the mist of a memory, you wander back to me, breathing my name with a sigh.
In the still of the night, once again I hold you tight,
Though you're gone, your love lives on when moonlight beams.
And as long as my heart will beat, lover, we'll always meet, here in my deep purple dreams.

DELILAH
I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window
I saw the flickering shadows of love on her blind
She was my woman, as she deceived me I watched and went out of my mind-OY!
	My, my, my, Delilah, why, why, why, Delilah?
	I could see that girl was no good for me, but I was lost like a slave that no man could free.....
At break of day when the man drove away I was waiting
I crossed the street to her house and she opened the door
She stood there laughing, I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more-OY!
	My, my, my, Delilah, why, why, why, Delilah?
	So, before they come to break down the door
	Forgive me, Delilah, I just couldn't take any more.
	Forgive me, Delilah, I just couldn't take any more.

DESPERADO
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?  You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one, but I know that you got your reasons,
These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow
	Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy, she'll beat you if she's able,
	You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
	Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
	But you only want the ones you can't get
Despe-rado, oh you ain't gettin' no younger, your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh, freedom, well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is  walkin' through this world all alone
	Don't your feet get cold in the winter time? The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
	It's hard to tell the night time from the day
	You're losin' all your highs and lows, ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away
Despe-rado,      why don't you come to your senses,  come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you,  ("let somebody love you")
You better let somebody love you..... before it's too late

DETOUR
Headed down life's crooked road, lots of things I never knowed
And, because of me not knowin', I now pine
Trouble got in the trail, spent the next five years in jail, should have read that detour sign
	Detour, there's a muddy road ahead, detour, paid no mind to what it said
	Detour, oh these bitter things I find, should have read that detour sign
When I got right to the place, where it said, "About face!"
I thought that all my worries were behind
But the farther I go, the more sorrow I know, should have read that detour sign
Detour, there's a muddy road ahead, detour, paid no mind to what it said
Detour, oh these bitter things I find, should have read that detour sign
When I got stuck in the mud, all my hopes dropped with a thud
And I reckoned my heart strings were made of twine
Have no willpower to get from the hole that I'm in yet, should have read that detour sign
	Detour there's a muddy road ahead detour paid no mind to what it said
	Detour all these bitter things I find should have read that detour sign
	Should have read that detour sign, should have read that detour sign

DEVIL IN DISGUISE
	You look like an angel, walk like an angel, talk like an angel, but I got wise
	You're the devil in disguise, oh, yes, you are, the devil in disguise
You fooled me with your kisses, you cheated, and you schemed
Heaven knows how you lied to me, you're not the way you seemed
	You look like an angel, walk like an angel, talk like an angel, but I got wise
	You're the devil in disguise, oh, yes, you are, the devil in disguise
I thought that I was in heaven, but I was sure surprised
Heaven help me, I didn't see the devil in your eyes
	You look like an angel, walk like an angel, talk like an angel, but I got wise
	You're the devil in disguise, oh, yes, you are, the devil in disguise

	You're the devil in disguise, oh, yes, you are, the devil in disguise
	Devil in disguise, devil in disguise

DEVIL OR ANGEL
Devil or angel, I can't make up my mind. Which one you are, I'd like to wake up and find.
Devil or angel, dear, whichever you are, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you.
Devil or angel, please say you'll be mine. Love me or leave me, I'll go out of my mind.
Devil or angel, dear, whichever you are, I need you, I need you, I  need you.
	You look like an angel, your smile is divine.
	But you keep me guessing, will you ever be mine?
Devil or angel, please say you'll be mine. Love me or leave me, I've made up my mind.
Devil or angel, dear, whichever you are, I love you, I love you, I love you.
SEA OF LOVE
Do you remember when we met, that's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you just how much I love you
Come with  me, oh  my love, to the sea,  the sea of love
I want to tell you just how much I love you
	Come with me to the Sea  of  Love
Devil or angel, please say you'll be mine. Love me or leave me, I've made up my mind.
Devil or angel, dear, whichever you are, I love you, I love you, I love you.

DIANA
I'm so young and you're so old, this, my darling, I've been told
I don't care just what they say, 'cause forever I will pray
You and I will be as free as the birds up in the trees
Oh, please, stay by me, Diana

Thrills I get when you hold me close, oh, my darling, you're the most
I love you but do you love me, oh, Diana, can't you see
I love you with all my heart and I hope we will never part
Oh, please, stay with me, Diana
	Oh, my darlin', oh my lover, tell me that there is no other
	I love you with my heart, oh-oh, oh-oh,  oh, don't you know I love you so and..
Only you can take my heart, only you can tear it apart
When you hold me in your loving arms, I can feel you giving all your charms,
Hold me, darling, hold me tight, squeeze me, baby, with a-all your might
Oh, please, stay by me, Diana.....oh, please, Diana.....oh, please, Diana

DIANE
     Smile for me, my Diane
I'm in heaven when I see you smile (see you smile), smile for me, my Diane (my Diane)
And though everything's dark, all the while, I can see you, Diane (bom-bom-bom)

You have lighted the road leading home, oh, pray for me, when you can (when you can)
But no matter wherever I roam, smile for me, my Diane  (repeat song)

DIARY
I found her diary underneath a tree, and started reading about me
The words she's written took me by surprise, you'd never read them in her eyes.
	They said that she had found the love she'd waited for
	Wouldn't you know it, she wouldn't show it
When she, confronted with the writing there, simply pretended not to care
I passed it off as just in keeping with her total, disconcerting air
	And, though she tried to hide the love that she denied,
	Wouldn't you know it, she wouldn't show it
     And, as I go through my life, I will give to her, my wife
     All the sweet things I can find
I found her diary underneath a tree, and started reading about me
The words began to stick, and tears to flow, her meaning now was clear to see
	The love she'd waited for was someone else, not me
	Wouldn't you know it, she wouldn't show it
     And, as I go through my life, I will give to her, his wife
     All the sweet things she can find, all the sweet things they can find

DIDN'T WE
This time we almost made the pieces fit, didn't we?
This time we almost some sense of it, didn't we?
This time I have the answer right here in my hand,
Then I touched it, and it has turned to sand.
This time we almost sang the song in tune, didn't we?
This time we almost made it to the moon, didn't we?
This time, we almost made (almost made) a poem rhyme
And this time we almost made that long hard climb.
Didn't we almost make it this time... this time.

DID YOU EVER HAVE TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND
Did you ever have to make up your mind, pick up on one and leave the other behind
It's not often easy and not often kind, did you ever have to make up your mind
Did you ever have to finally decide, say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes and tears you must hide, Did you ever have to finally decide
	Sometimes there's one with big blue eyes, cute as a bunny
	With hair down to here, and plenty of money
	And just when you think she's that one in the world
	Your heart gets stolen by some mousey little girl
And then you know you'd better make up your mind...pick up on one and leave the other behind
It's not often easy and not often kind, did you ever have to make up your mind
	Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
	And then you get distracted by her older sister
	When in walks her father and takes you a line
	And says, "You better go home, son, and make up your mind"
And then you bet you'd better finally decide...say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes and tears you must hide, did you ever have to finally decide

DIFFERENT DRUM
You and I travel to the beat of a different drum
Oh can't you tell by the way I run, every time you make eyes at me, wo-oh

You cry and moan and say it will work out
But honey child I've got my doubts, you can't see the forest for the trees
	Oh don't get me wrong, it's not that I knock it
	It's just that I am not in the market for a girl who wants to love only me
Yes, and I ain't sayin' you ain't pretty,  all I'm sayin' is I'm not ready
For any person place or thing to try and pull the reins in on me

So good-bye I'll be leavin', I see no sense in this cryin' and grievin'
We'll both live a lot longer if you live without me

DINAH
Carolina gave me Dinah, I'm the proudest one beneath the Dixie sun
News is spreadin' 'bout a weddin'
I hear church bells ringin', here's the song my heart keeps singin'

Dinah, is there anyone finer, in the state of Carolina. If there is and you know her, show her to me
Dinah, with her Dixie eyes blazin', how I love to sit and gaze in-to the eyes of Dinah Lee
	Every night why do I shake with fright, because my Dinah might change her mind about me
Dinah, if she wandered to China, I would hop an ocean liner, just to be with Dinah Lee.

DINDI
Sky, so vast is the sky, with far away clouds, just wandering by
Where do they go? Oh I don't know, don't know  
Wind, that speaks to the leaves,  telling stories that no one believes
Stories of love belong to you and me  
Oh, Dindi, if I only had words, I would say all the beautiful things that I see
When you're with me, oh my Dindi! 
Oh, Dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees
That's how my heart is singing, Dindi, happy Dindi, when you're with me! 
I love you more each day, yes I do, yes I do . . .
I'd let you go away, If you take me with you! 
Don't you know, Dindi, I'd be running and searching for you,
Like a river that can't find the sea,  that would be me, without you, my Dindi! 
 
DIXIE
Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton, old times there are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away, Dixie Land
In Dixie Land where I was born in, early on one frosty mornin'
Look away, look away, look away, Dixie Land
Oh, I wish I was in Dixie Away! Away!
In Dixie Land I'll take my stand to live and die in Dixie.
A-way, a-way, a-way down South in Dixie.
A-way, a-way, a-way down South in Dixie.

DOCTOR MY EYES
Doctor, my eyes have seen the years and the slow parade of fears, without crying,
Now I want to understand
I have done all that I could to see the evil and the good, without hiding
You must help me, if you can
     Doctor, my eyes tell me what is wrong. Was I unwise to leave them open for so long?
'Cause I have wandered through this world, and as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will, I never noticed them until
I got this feeling that it's later than it seems
     Doctor, my eyes tell me what you see. I hear their cries, just say if it's too late for me
     Doctor, my eyes cannot see the sky. Is this the prize for having learned how not to cry?

DOES ANYBODY REALLY KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS
As I was walking down the street one day
A man came up to me and asked me what the time was that was on my watch, yeah, and I said:
           Does anybody really know what time it is? Does anybody really care?
           If so, I can't imagine why! We've all got time enough to cry.
And I was walking down the street one day
A pretty lady looked at me and said her diamond watch had stopped cold dead, and I said:
           Does anybody really know what time it is? Does anybody really care?
           If so, I can't imagine why! We've all got time enough to cry.
And I was walking down the street one day,
Being pushed and shoved by people trying to beat the clock, oh ho, I just don't know, I don't know
And I said:
           Does anybody really know what time it is? Does anybody really care?
           If so, I can't imagine why! We've all got time enough to die.

DOES YOUR CHEWING GUM LOSE ITS FLAVOR
Oh me, oh my, oh you, whatever shall I do? Hallelujah, the question is peculiar
I'd give a lot of dough, if only I could know
The answer to my question: Is it yes or is it no?
	Does your chewing gum lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight?
	If your mother says don't chew it, do you swallow it in spite?
	Can you catch it on your tonsils, can you heave it left and right?
	Does your chewing gum lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight?
Here comes the blushing bride, the groom is by her side
Up to the altar, just as steady as Gibraltar
The groom has got the ring, and it's such a pretty thing
But as he slips it on her finger, the choir begins to sing:
  CHORUS
Now the nation rise as one, to send their honored son
Up to the White House, yes, the nation's only White House
To voice their discontent unto the PresIdent
Up-on the burning question what has swept this continent?
  QUESTION: What sound do you hear when you drop a ukulele from the 20th floor to the concrete below?   ANSWER: Applause!
  CHORUS
On the bedpost over-night
                                  (Hello there, I love you, and I wanna hold you tight-
                                   Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Sat'day night!)
On the bedpost over-night
                                    (A dollar is a dollar and a dime is a dime!-)
                                     He'd sing another chorus but he hasn't got the time!)
On the bedpost over-night

DO I LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
Do I love you because you're beautiful, or are you beautiful because I love you?
Am I making believe I see in you a girl too lovely to be really true?
Do I want you because you're wonderful,
Or are you wonderful because I want you?
Are you the sweet invention of a lover's dream
Or are you really as beautiful as you seem?

DO YOU WANNA DANCE
Ah, ah, ah, ah,
Well, do you wanna dance under the moonlight, squeeze me all through the night
      Oh, baby, do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna dance, and hold my hand, tell me I'm your lovin' man
     Oh, baby, do you wanna dance?
	Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
	Do you do you do you do you wanna dance, oh, baby, do you  wanna dance
	Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
	Do you do you do you do you wanna dance, oh, baby, do you  wanna dance
Ah, ah, ah, ah, let's dance!

DON'T
Don't, don't, that's what you say each time that I hold you this way
When I feel like this, and I want to kiss you, baby, don't say don't

Don't, don't leave my embrace, for here in my arms is your place
When the night grows cold, and I want to hold you, baby, don't say don't
	If you think that this is just a game I'm playing
	If you think that I don't mean every word I'm saying
Don't, don't, don't feel that way, I'm your, love, and yours I will stay
This you can believe, I will never leave you
Heaven knows I won't. Baby, don't say don't  (Don't, please don't)

LOVING YOU
I will spend my whole life through, loving you, loving you.
Winter, summer, spring-time, too, loving you, loving you.
Makes no difference where I go or what I do.
You know that I'll always be loving you.

If I'm seen with someone new, don't be blue, don't be blue.
I'll be faithful I'll be true, always true, true to you.
There is only one for me, and you know who.
You know that I'll always be loving you.

DON'T BE A BABY, BABY
Don't be a baby, baby, 'bout a love that passed you by
But, if you have to, baby, go ahead and have your cry
I'll be your baby, baby, truer than the one you knew
Then, someday, baby, maybe, baby, you will learn to love me too..

DON'T BE CRUEL
You know I can be found sitting home all alone
If you can't come around, at least please telephone.
	Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Baby, if I made you mad for something I might have said
Please let's forget the past, the future looks bright ahead
	Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
	I don't want no other love, baby, it's just you I'm thinking of.
Don't stop thinking of me, don't make me feel this way
Come on over here and love me, you know what I want you to say
	Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
	Why should we be apart, I really love you, baby, cross my heart.
Let's walk up to the preacher, and let us say, "I do."
Then you'll know you have me, And I'll know that I'll have you.
	Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
	I don't want no other love, baby, it's just you I'm thinking of.

DON'T BLAME ME
Don't blame me for falling in love with you.
I'm under your spell but how can I help it? Don't blame me
Can't you see when you do the things you do
If I can't conceal the way that I'm feeling,
Don't blame me...
	I can't help it if that doggone moon above
	Makes me need someone like you to love.
Blame your kiss, as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms, but don't blame me.

DON'T BUY THE LIVERWURST
When you go to the delicatessen store, don't buy the liverwurst
Don't buy the liverwurst, don't buy the liverwurst
I repeat what I just said before, don't buy the liverwurst, don't buy the liverwurst
	Oh, buy the corned beef, if you must, the pickled herring you can trust,
	And the lox puts you in orbit A-OK!
	But that big hunk of liverwurst has been there since October first,
	And today's the twenty-third of May
So, when you go to the delicatessen store, don't buy the liverwurst
Don't buy the liverwurst, don't buy the liverwurst
It'll make your insides awful sore, don't buy the liverwurst,
Don't buy the liverwurst, don't buy the liverwurst.    IT'S THE WURST!

DON'T CRY OUT LOUD
Baby cried the day the circus came to town
'Cause she didn't want parades just passin' by her
So she painted on a smile, and took up with some clown
While she danced without a net upon the wire
I know a lot about her, 'cause, you see, baby is an awful lot like me
	Don't cry out loud, just keep it inside, learn how to hide your feelings
	Fly high and proud, and if you should fall, remember you almost had it all
Baby saw that when they pulled the big top down,
They left behind her dreams among the litter
And the different kind of love she thought she'd found
There was nothing left but sawdust and some glitter
But baby can't be broken, 'cause you see, she had the finest teacher-that was me-I told her
	Don't cry out loud, just keep it inside, and learn how to hide your feelings
	Fly high and proud, and if you should fall, remember you almost had it all
Don't cry out loud, just keep it inside, and learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud, and if you should fall, remember you almost made it
	Don't cry out loud, just keep it inside, and learn how to hide your feelings
	Fly high and proud, and if you should fall, remember you almost had it all

DON'T FENCE ME IN
	Wild Cat Kelly, looking mighty pale, standing by the sheriff's side
	When that sheriff said, "I'm sending you to jail," Wild Cat raised his head and cried:
Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above........don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love.........don't fence me in
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze, listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever, but I ask you  please........don't fence me in
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle underneath the western skies
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder till I see the mountains rise
I want to Ride to the ridge where the west com-mences, gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
Can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences,  don't fence me in.
	Wild Cat Kelly, back again in town, sitting by his sweetheart's side
	When his sweetheart said, "C'mon, let's settle down"
	Wild Cat raised his head and cried  ("Oh, give me land.......")

DON'T GET AROUND MUCH ANYMORE
Missed the Saturday dance, heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you, don't get around much anymore
Thought I'd visit the club, got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you, don't get around much anymore
	Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
	But nevertheless, why stir up memories?
Been invited on dates. Might have gone, but what for
Awfully different without you, don't get around much anymore.

DON'T HANG UP
	Don't hang up (no, no.) Oh, don't you do it now, don't hang up (no, no.)
Don't hang up like you always do, I know you think I wasn't true, I'll explain the facts to you
Don't hang up. Give me a chance or our romance is through.
	Don't hang up (no, no.) Oh, don't you do it now, don't hang up. (no, no.)
I took a walk with Mary Lou, we ran around to visit Sue, she had some boys I never knew.
Don't hang up. They took a ride so, baby, I went too.
       Stopped at the record hop, I had to be a sport.
       We stomped and we did the Slop, then you walked in, and I was caught.
	Don't hang up (no, no.) Oh, don't you do it now, don't hang up. (no, no.)
'Cause you got some explainin' too, who was that chick I saw with you? So, talk fast like you always do.
Don't hang up. You've got one chance, or our romance is through.
        (Instrumental)  Then you walked in, and you were caught.
	Don't hang up (no, no.) Oh, don't you do it now, don't hang up. (no, no.)
I didn't say our love was through, but if we made a fool for two, 'cause making up is fun to do,
Don't hang up. 'Cause no one else will ever do but you.
Don't hang up (no, no.) Oh, don't you do it now, don't hang up, (no, no.) or you'll be sorry, baby
Don't hang up (no, no.) Oh, don't you do it now, don't hang up, (no, no.) or you'll be sorry, baby

DON'T IT MAKE MY BROWN EYES BLUE
Don't know when I've been so blue. Don't know what's come over you
You've found someone new, and don't it make my brown eyes blue

I'll be fine when you're gone. I'll just cry all night long
Say it isn't true, and don't it make my brown eyes blue
	Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies, give me no reasons, give me alibis
	Tell me you love me and don't let me cry, say anything but don't say goodbye
I didn't mean to treat you bad, didn't know just what I had
But, honey, now I do, and don't it make my brown eyes
And don't it make my brown eyes, and don't it make my brown eyes blue

And don't it make my brown eyes, and don't it make my brown eyes blue
And don't it make my brown eyes blue  (repeat last 2 lines)

DON'T LET GO
Hear that whistle, it's ten o'clock. (DLG2) Come on, baby, it's time to rock (DLG2)
I'm so happy I got you here. (DLG2) Keeps me grinnin' from ear to ear (DLG2)
     Ooh wee, this feelin's killin' me, aw shucks, well, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks
     I love you so, just hold me tight and don't let go
Thunder, lightnin', wind and rain. (DLG2) Love is hummin' inside my brain (DLG2)
I'm so eager, I'm nearly dyin' (DLG2) You been keepin' your lips from mine (DLG2)
	[Chorus]
Hound dog barking upside the hill (DLG2) Love is draggin' him through the mill (DLG2)
If it wasn't for havin' you (DLG2) I'd be barkin' and howlin' too (DLG2)
	[Chorus]
One day, baby, you'll quit me yet (DLG2) I'll be cryin' and soakin' wet (DLG2)
One thing, baby, I'll never stand (DLG2) Your lips kiss some other man (DLG2)
	[Chorus]
Just hold me tight (don't let go)  Just hold me tight (don't let go)
Hold me tight (don't let go) Mmm hmm (don't let go)

DON'T LET IT GO TO YOUR HEAD
You bet she'll flirt, but don't let it go to your head
You might get hurt, so don't let it go to your head
	She doesn't ask any questions, save all the answers, you found her at last
	And now you're part of a session that's moving too fast
She'll hold your hand, but don't try to reach for the sky
You'll understand, as soon as the evening rolls by
	She wears my ring on her finger, she'll never linger, so, brother, you're dead
	And just like I said, don't let it go to your head
     I'm her guy, it's time to confess, you just missed the boat to happiness
     So, just like I said, don't let it go to your head

DON'T LET ME BE LONELY TONIGHT
Do me wrong, do me right, tell me lies but hold me tight
Save your good-byes for the morning light, but don't let me be lonely tonight
Say good-bye and say hello,  sure 'nuf good to see you  but it's time to go
Don't say yes but please don't say no, I don't want to be lonely tonight
	Go away then damn ya, go on and do as you please
	You ain't gonna see me getting down on my knees
	 I'm undecided and your heart's been divided
	You've been turning my world upside down
Do me wrong, do me right, right now baby, go on and tell me lies but hold me tight
Save your good-byes for the morning light (morning light),
But don't let me be lonely tonight
I don't want to be lonely to-night, oh no... I don't want to be lonely tonight.

DON'T LET ME BE MISUNDERSTOOD
Baby, do you understand me now, sometimes I feel a little mad
But don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad
	But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
	Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree, with a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have to do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
	But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
	Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
     If I seem edgy I want you to know that I never mean to take it out on you
     Life has its problems, and I get my share, and that's one thing I never meant to do
     'Cause I love you
Oh, oh, baby, don't you know I'm human, have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself long regretting some foolish thing some little simple thing I've done
	I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
	Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
	Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
	Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
	Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
	Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood


DON'T LET THE SUN CATCH YOU CRYIN'
Don't let the sun catch you cryin', the night's the time for all your tears
Your heart may be broken tonight, but tomorrow in the morning light
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
The night-time shadows disappear. And with them go all your tears
For the morning will bring joy for every girl and boy
So don't let the sun catch you cryin'
We know that cryin's not a bad thing, but stop your cryin' when the birds sing
It may be hard to discover that you've been left for another
But don't forget that love's a game, and it can always come again
Oh don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Don't let the sun catch you cryin', oh no, oh, oh, oh

DON'T MAKE PROMISES
It seems the songs we're singin' are all about tomorrow, tunes of promises you can't keep
Every moment bringin' a love I can only borrow, you're tellin' me lies in your sleep
Do you think I'm not aware of what you're sayin', or why you're sayin' it?
Is it hard to keep me where you want me staying, don't go on betrayin'.
	Don't make promises you can't keep
We had a chance to find it, our time was now or never, you promised me things that I need
Again, the things behind it took away the chance forever, you're tellin' me lies in your sleep
Do you think I'm not aware of what you're sayin', or why you're sayin' it?
Is it hard to keep me where you want me stayin', don't go on betrayin'.
	Don't make promises you can't keep, don't make promises you can't keep

DON'T PULL YOUR LOVE
Don't pull your love out on me, baby. If you do then I think that maybe
I'll just lay me down, cry for a hundred years.
Don't pull your love out on me, honey, take my heart, my soul, my money,
But don't leave me a-drowning in my tears.
	You say you're gonna leave,  gonna take that big white bird.
	Gonna fly right out of here,  without a single word.
	But you know you'll break my heart, when I watch you close that door
	'Cause I know that I won't see you anymore.
Haven't I been good to you? What about that brand new ring?
Doesn't that mean love to you,  doesn't that mean anything?
If I threw a-way my pride, and I got down on  my knees
Would you make me beg you, pretty please?
   	There's so much I wanna do, and I've got love enough for two.
	But I'll never use it, girl, if I don't have you.

DON'T SAY NOTHIN' BAD ABOUT MY BABY
   Refrain 1:
	(Don't say nothin' bad about my baby) Oh, no,
	(Don't say nothin' bad about my baby) I love him so
	(Don't say nothin' bad about my baby) Oh, don't you know
	(Don't say nothin' bad about my baby)
	He's good (he's good), he's good to me (good to me) That's all I care about
Oh, no (Don't you tell me my baby's just a playboy)
It isn't true (Don't you tell me my baby's just a playboy)
That's a lie  (I don't listen to a single word they say, boy)
He's my guy (Don't you tell me my baby's just a playboy)
He's true (he's true) he's true to me (true to me) So, girl, you'd better ship him out
　　　　	(Everybody says he's lazy) But not when he's kissin' me
　　　　	(Everybody says he's crazy) Sure, he's crazy, crazy 'bout me
Oh, yeah,  (Don't say nothin' bad about my baby)
Oh, no,  (Don't say nothin' bad about my baby)
I love him so  (Don't say nothin' bad about my baby)
Oh, don't you know  (Don't say nothin' bad about my baby)
He's good (he's good), he's good to me (good to me) And that's all I care about (fade)

DON'T SIT UNDER THE APPLE TREE
I wrote my mother, I wrote my father, and now I'm writing you too
I'm sure of mother, I'm sure of father, and now I want to be sure, very, very sure of you

Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me, no, no, no
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me, till I come marching home
Don't go walking down lovers' lane with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me, no, no, no
Don't go walking down lovers' lane with anyone else but me, till I come marching home
	I just got word from a guy who heard from the guy next door to me
	The girl he met just loves to pet, and it fits you to a "T"
	So don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me. till I come marching home,
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me, no, no, no
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me, till I come marching,
Hup, two, three, four, till I come marching home!

DON'T STOP
If you wake up, and don't want to smile, if it takes just a little while
Open your eyes, and look at the day, you'll see things in a different way
	Don't stop thinkin' about tomorrow, don't stop, it'll soon be here
	It'll be here, better than before, yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone
Why not think about times to come, and not about the things that you've done?
If your life was bad to you, just think what tomorrow will do
	Don't stop thinkin' about tomorrow, don't stop, it'll soon be here
	It'll be here, better than before, yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone
All I want is to see you smile, if it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true, I never meant any harm to you
	Don't stop thinkin' about tomorrow, don't stop, it'll soon be here
	It'll be here, better than before, yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone
    		Don't you look back, don't you look back, etc.

DON'T STOP BELIEVIN'
Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world, she took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit, he took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room, the smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night, it goes on and on, and on, and on
     Strangers, waiting, up and down the boulevard, their shadows searching in the night
     Streetlights, people livin' just to find emotion, hidin' somewhere in the night
Workin' hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time

Some'll win, some will lose, some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends, it goes on and on, and on, and on
     Strangers, waiting, up and down the boulevard, their shadows searching in the night
     Streetlights, people livin' just to find emotion, hidin' somewhere in the night
	Don't stop believin', hold on to that feelin', streetlight people
	Don't stop believin', hold on, streetlight people

DON'T THINK TWICE, IT'S ALRIGHT
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe. if'n you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe, it'll never do somehow
     When your rooster crows at the break of dawn, look out your window, and I'll be gone
     You're the reason I'm a-traveling on, but don't think twice, it's all right.
And It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe, the light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe, I'm on the dark side of the road
     But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say to try and make me change my mind and stay
     But we never did too much talkin' anyway, buy don't think twice, it's all right.
So It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal, like you never done before
And It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal, I can't hear you any more
     I'm a-thinking and a-wonderin' walking down the road, I once loved a woman, a child I am told
     I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul, but don't think twice, it's all right.
So long honey, babe, where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe, so I'll just say fare thee well
     I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind, you could have done better, but I don't mind
     You just kinda wasted my precious time, but don't think twice, it's all right.

DON'T YOU JUST KNOW IT
I can't lose with the stuff I use (DYJKI) Baby, don't believe I wear two left shoes (DYJKI)
	Ah ha ha ha (AHHH) Ay, ay, oh (AAO) Gooba, gooba, gooba, gooba (GGGG)
	Ah ha ha ha (AHHH) Ah ha ha ha (AHHH) Ay, ay, oh (Ay, ay, oh)

DON'T YOU KNOW I CARE
Don't you know I care, or don't you care to know?
If you know that I care, how could you hurt me so?
Darling, you are part of every breath I take
Will you break my heart, or give my heart a break?
	I can't figure out what love's all about, and where I fit into your scheme
	Am I wasting time? Please, tell me, 'cause I'm down to my last dream
Won't you, please, be fair? Love me or let me go
Don't you know I care, or don't you care to know?

Won't you, please, be fair? Love me or let me go
Don't you know I care, or don't you care to know?
        Please be fair. Never let me go, or don't you care to know?

DON'T YOU WORRY 'BOUT A THING
Everybody's got a thing, but some don't know how to handle it
Always reachin' out in vain, accepting the things not worth having,
	But, don't you worry 'bout a thing, don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
	'Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out
They say your style of life's a drag, and that you must go other places
But just don't you feel too bad, when you get fooled by smiling faces, but,
	Don't you worry 'bout a thing, don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
	'Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out
	When you get it off...your trip
             Don't you worry 'bout a thing, don't you worry 'bout a thing
Everybody needs a change, a chance to check out the new
But you're the only one to see the changes you take yourself through
	But, don't you worry 'bout a thing, don't you worry 'bout a thing, pretty mama
	'Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, on't you worry 'bout a thing,

A DOODLIN' SONG
     Do do-de-oo do-de-oo do-de-oo-de-oo, do do-de-oo do-de-oo do-de-oo-de-oo
     Do do-de-oo do-de-oo do-de-oo-de-oo
	Why don't you join the group? It's better than being a party-poop!
Obbligato, pizzicato, Guy Lombardo, it's the craziest
When you noodle with a doodlin' song,
	Two, three, four, like it so much, I'll doodle some more
Little softer, Perry Como, even softer, pianissimo
Say you love me with a doodlin' song
	B, C, D, ooo, what you doodle-de-do to me
     Say you love me, really love me, say you love me true
     Say you love me, please believe me. When you do, that makes two who
Go together, bet your boodle, like the apples in a strudel do
When you noodle with a doodlin' song
	What you call a real ball
     Do do-de-oo do-de-oo do-de-oo-de-oo, do do-de-oo do-de-oo, I love you
     Do do-de-oo do-de-oo do-de-oo-de-oo
Here we go now, bet your boodle, like the apples in the strudel do
Then we noodle with a doodlin' song.....all through, thank you

DO RE MI
Let's start at the very beginning, a very good place to start
When you read, you begin with ABC, when you sing you begin with DO RE MI
DO, RE, MI, DO, RE, MI, DO, RE, MI, the first three notes just happen to be
...DO, RE, MI,
DOE, a deer, a female deer, RAY, a drop of golden sun
ME, a name I call myself, FAR, a long, long way to go
SEW, a needle pulling thread, LA, a note to follow sew
TEA, a drink with jam and bread, that will bring us back to do, do, do, do

DO THAT TO ME ONE MORE TIME

DO WAH DIDDY DIDDY
There she was, just walkin' down the street, singin', "Do wah diddy, diddy dum, diddy do"
Snappin' her fingers, and shufflin' her feet, singin', "Do wah diddy, diddy dum, diddy do"
	She looked good (looked good), she looked fine (looked fine)
	She looked good, she looked fine, and I nearly lost my mind
Before I knew it, she was walkin' next to me, singin', "Do wah diddy, diddy dum, diddy do"
Holdin' my hand, just as natural as can be, singin', "Do wah diddy, diddy dum, diddy do"
	We walked on (walked on), to my door (my door)
	We walked on to my door, then we kissed a little more
     Whoa, oh, I knew we was falling in love
     Yes, I did, and so I told her all the things I'd been dreamin' of
Now we're together nearly every single day, singin', "Do wah diddy, diddy dum, diddy do"
We're so happy, and that's how we're gonna stay, singin', "Do wah diddy, diddy dum, diddy do"
	Well, I'm hers (I'm hers), she's mine (she's mine)
	I'm hers, she's mine, wedding bells are gonna chime
     Whoa, oh, I knew we was falling in love
     Yes, I did, and so I told her all the things I'd been dreamin' of
Now we're together nearly every single day, singin', "Do wah diddy, diddy dum, diddy do"

DOWN AT THE TWIST AND SHOUT
	Saturday night and the moon is out, I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout.
	Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat. When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet.
	Out in the middle of a big dance floor, when I hear that fiddle wanna beg for more
	Wanna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight.
Well, I never have a-wandered down to New Orleans, I never have drifted down a bayou stream
But I heard that music on the radio, and I swore some day I was gonna go
Down Highway 10, just to Lafayette, there's a Baton Rouge, and I won't forget
To send you a card with my regrets, 'cause I'm never gonna come back home
	Instrumental
They got alligator stew and a crawfish pie, a gulf storm blowing into town tonight
Living on the Delta's quite a show, they got hurricane parties every time it blows
And here up north it's a cold, cold rain, and there ain't no cure for my blues today
Except when the paper says Beausoleil is coming into town, baby let's go down.
	Chorus  ("Saturday night.....")
Bring your mama, bring your papa, bring your sister too, they got lots of music, and lots of room
When they play you a waltz from 1910, you gonna feel a little bit young again
Well, you learned to dance with your rock 'n' roll, you learned to swing with a do-si-do
But you learn to love at the fais-so-do, when you hear a little Jolie Blond
	Chorus  ("Saturday night.....")

DOWN BY THE RIVERSIDE
I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside, down by the riverside
I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside
	I ain't a' gonna study war no more  X3
	I ain't a' gonna study war no more  X3
Gonna join hands with everyone
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside, down by the riverside
Gonna join hands with everyone, down by the riverside.  (I ain't a'gonna study.....)

Gonna ring out a song of joy
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside, down by the riverside
Gonna ring out a song of joy, down by the riverside. (I ain't a'gonna study....)

McDONALD'S IS YOUR KIND OF PLACE
McDonald's is your kind of place, hamburgers in your face
French fries up your nose, mustard between your toes
The last time that I ate there, they stole my underwear
McDonald's is the place for me. (I ain't a'gonna study....)

DOWN IN THE BOONDOCKS
	Down in the boondocks, down in the boondocks
	People put me down 'cause that's the side of town I was born in
	I love her, she loves me, but I don't fit her society
	Lord have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks
Every night I will watch the light from the house upon the hill
I love a little girl that lives up there, and I guess I always will
But I don't dare knock on her door, 'cause her daddy is my boss man
So I'll just have to be content to see her whenever I can
	Down in the boondocks........
One fine day I'll find a way to move from this old shack
I'll hold my head up like a king, and I never, never will look back
Until that morning I'll work and slave, and I'll save every dime
But tonight she'll have to steal away to see me one more time
	Down in the boondocks........

DOWN IN THE VALLEY
Down in the valley, the valley so low, hang your head over, hear the wind blow
Hear the wind blow boys, hear the wind blow, hang your head over, hear the wind blow
Roses love sunshine, violets love dew, angels in heaven know I love you
Know I love you, dear, know I love you, angels in heaven know I love you
Write me a letter, send it by mail, send it in care of the Birmingham jail
Birmingham jail, love, Birmingham jail, send it in care of the Birmingham jail.
Down in the valley, the valley so low, hang your head over, hear the wind blow
Hear the wind blow boys, hear the wind blow, hang your head over, hear the wind blow

DOWN ON THE CORNER
Early in the evenin' just about supper-time,
Over by the courthouse they're starting to unwind
Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up
Willy picks a tune out, and he blows it on the harp
	Down on the corner, out in the street
	Willy and the Poorboys are playin', bring a nickel, tap your feet
Rooster hits the washboard, and people just got to smile
Blinky thumps the gut bass and solos for a while
Poorboy twangs the rhythm out on his Kalamazoo
Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo
	Chorus
You don't need a penny just to hang around
But if you've got a nickel, won't you lay your money down?
Over on the corner there's a happy noise
People come from all around to watch the magic boy
	Chorus

DOWNTOWN
When you're alone and life is making you lonely you can always go downtown
When you've got worries all the noise and the hurry seems to help I know- downtown
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty, how can you lose?
    The lights are much brighter there you can forget all your troubles forget all your cares and go
    Downtown- where all the lights are bright, downtown-waiting for you tonight
    Downtown- it's gonna be alright now.
Don't hang around and let your troubles surround you there are movie shows-downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to where they never close-downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova,
You'll be dancing with it too before the night is over, happy again.....CHORUS ("The lights")

DO YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC
Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her, whenever it starts
And it's magic, if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout rock and roll
	If you believe in magic don't bother to choose
	If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
	Just go and listen it'll start with a smile
	It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
	Your feet start tapping and you can't seem to find
	How you got there, so just blow your mind
If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning 'til there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me
	Yeah, do you believe in magic
	Yeah, believe in the magic of a young girl's soul
	Believe in the magic of rock and roll
	Believe in the magic that can set you free
	Ohh, talking 'bout magic
Do you believe like I believe Do you believe in magic
Do you believe like I believe Do you believe, believer
Do you believe like I believe Do you believe in magic

DO YOU LOVE ME
	You broke my heart, 'cause I couldn't dance. You didn't even want me around
	And now I'm back, to let you know, I can really shake 'em down
Do you love me (I can really move), do you love me (I'm in the groove)
And do you love me (Do you love me), now that I can dance (dance)
	Watch me now, hey, (work, work), oh, work it out baby (work work),
	Well, you're drivin' me crazy (work, work), just a little bit of soul now (work)
I can mash-potato (I can mash-potato), do the twist (I can do the twist)
Now, tell me, baby, (tell me baby) do you like it like this? (Do you like it like this)
Tell me (tell me), tell me.
Do you love me? (Do you love me?) Now, do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Now, do you love me? (Do you love me?) Now that I can dance (dance)
	Watch me now, hey, (work, work), oh, shake it up, shake it up(work, work)
	Oh, shake 'em, shake 'em down (work, work), oh, a little bit of soul now (work)
(Work, work) Oh, shake it, shake it, baby (work, work), oh, you're drivin' me crazy
(Work, work) Oh, don't get lazy (work)
I can mash-potato (I can mash-potato), do the twist (I can do the twist)
Now, tell me, baby, (tell me baby) do you like it like this? (Do you like it like this)
Tell me (tell me), tell me. Do love me?

DO YOU WANNA DANCE
Ah, ah, ah, ah,
Well, do you wanna dance under the moonlight, squeeze me all through the night
      Oh, baby, do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna dance, and hold my hand, tell me I'm your lovin' man
     Oh, baby, do you wanna dance?
	Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
	Do you do you do you do you wanna dance, oh, baby, do you  wanna dance
	Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
	Do you do you do you do you wanna dance, oh, baby, do you  wanna dance
Ah, ah, ah, ah, let's dance!

DO YOU WANT TO KNOW A SECRET?
You'll never know how much I really love you. You'll never know how much I really care
Listen, do you want to know a secret, Do you promise not to tell, woh, oh, oh.
Closer, let me whisper in your ear,  Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you, woo, oo, oo, oo.
	I've known a secret for a week or two, nobody knows, just we two.
Listen, do you want to know a secret? Do you promise not to tell, woh, oh, oh.
Closer, let me whisper in your ear, sahy the words you long to hear, woo, oo, oo, oo.

DREAM
Dream when you're feeling blue, dream, that's the thing to do
Dream while the smoke rings rise in the air, you'll find your share of memories there
So dream when the day is through, dream, and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem, so dream, dream, dream.

DREAM A LITTLE DREAM
Stars shining bright above you, night breezes seem to whisper "I love you."
Birds singing in the sycamore tree, dream a little dream of me.
Say "Nightie-night" and kiss me, just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be, dream a little dream of me.
	Stars fading but I linger on, dear, still craving your kiss
	I'm longing to linger 'til dawn, dear, just saying this...
Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be, dream a little dream of me.
But in your dreams whatever they be, dream a little dream of me.

DREAM BABY
	Sweet dream baby, sweet dream baby, sweet dream baby, how long must I dream?
Dream baby, got me dreaming sweet dreams, the whole day through
Dream baby, got me dreaming sweet dreams, the night-time too
I love you and I'm dreaming of you, that won't do
Dream baby, make me stop my dreaming, you can make my dreams come true
	Sweet dream baby, sweet dream baby, sweet dream baby, how long must I dream?
Dream baby, got me dreaming sweet dreams, the whole day through
Dream baby, got me dreaming sweet dreams, the night-time too
I love you and I'm dreaming of you, that won't do
Dream baby, make me stop my dreaming, you can make my dreams come true
	Ah, sweet dream baby, sweet dream baby, yeah, sweet dream baby, how long must I dream?
	Sweet dream baby, sweet dream baby, sweet dream baby, how long must I dream?

DREAM, DREAM, DREAM
What do I do on Monday? Dream, dream, dream
What do I do on Tuesday? Dream, dream, dream
	Wednesday, Thursday comes, and then I do the same thing over again
Oh, what do I do on Friday? Dream, dream, dream, gee, but I'm a busy guy!
	I make a nice living, strange as it seems. I'm a guy, getting by, living on dreams
And, what do I do on weekends? I'm with you. Then my dreams come true!

DREAMER'S HOLIDAY
Climb up on a butterfly and take off on the breeze,
Let your worries flutter by, and do the things you please,
In the land where dollar bills would be falling off the trees, on a dreamer's holiday.
Everyday for breakfast, there's a dish of scrambled stars,
And for luncheon you'll be munching rainbow candy bars,
You'll be livin' a la mode on Jupiter or Mars, on a dreamer's holi - day.
	Make it a long vacation, time there is plenty of,
	You need no reservation, just bring along the one that you love.
Help yourself to happiness, and sprinkle it with mirth,
Close your eyes and concentrate and dream for all you're worth,
You will feel terrific when you get back down to earth,
From a dreamer's holiday from a dreamer's holiday

DREAMIN'
Dreamin', I'm always dreamin', dreamin' love will be mine
Searchin', I'm always searchin', hopin' someday I'll find
	Someone, someone to love me, someone to need me, but, until then
Well, I'll keep on dreamin', keep right on dreamin'
Dreamin', till my dreamin' comes true ue ue...............

Dreamin', I'm always dreamin', dreamin' love will be mine
Searchin', I'm always searchin', hopin' someday I'll find
	Someone, someone to love me, someone to need me, but, until then
Well, I'll keep on dreamin', keep right on dreamin'
Dreamin', till my dreamin' comes true ue ue...............

A DREAM IS A WISH YOUR HEART MAKES
A dream is a wish your heart makes when you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose your heartaches, whatever you wish for, you keep

Have faith in your dreams, and, someday your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving, if you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true

DREAM LOVER
Every night I hope and pray a dream lover will come my way.
A girl to hold in my arms and know the magic of her charms
	Because I want a girl to call my own,
	I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone
Dream lover, where are you with a love, oh, so true
And a hand that I can hold to feel you near when I grow old
	Because I want a girl to call my own,
	I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone
Some day, I don't know how, I hope you'll hear my plea
Some way, I don't know how, she'll bring er love to me.

Dream lover, until then I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do until my lover's dreams come true
Because I want a girl to call my own I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone.


DREAMS OF THE EVERYDAY HOUSEWIFE
She looks in the mirror, and stares at the wrinkles that weren't there yesterday
And thinks of the young man that she almost married
What would he think if he saw her this way
She picks up her apron in little girl fashion, as something comes into her mind
Slowly starts dancing, remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line
	Ah, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
	You see everywhere anytime of the day
	An everyday housewife who gave up the good time for me
The photograph album she takes from the closet, and slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her, now withered with age
She closes her eyes and touches the housedress that suddenly disappears
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years
	Ah, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
	You see everywhere anytime of the day
	An everyday housewife who gave up the good time for me

DREYDL, DREYDL, DREYDL
I have a little dreydl, I made it out of clay
And when it's dry and ready, then dreydl I shall play.
	O dreydl, dreydl, dreydl, I made it out of clay
	O dreydl dreydl, dreydl, now dreydl I shall play.
It has a lovely body, with leg so short and thin
And when it is all tired, it drops and then I win.
	O dreydl, dreydl, dreydl, with leg so short and thin
	O dreydl, dreydl, dreydl, it drops and then I win.
My dreydl is so playful, it loves to dance and spin.
A happy game of dreydl, come play, now let's begin.
	O dreydl, dreydl, dreydl, it loves to dance and spin.
	O dreydl, dreydl, dreydl, come play, now let's begin.

DRIFT AWAY
Day after day I'm more confused, yet I look for the light through the pourin' rain
You know, that's a game, that I hate to lose,  and I'm feelin' the strain, ain't it a shame
   Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul, I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
   Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul, I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Beginnin' to think that I'm wastin' time, I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind, and I'm countin' on you, to carry me through
   Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul, I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
   Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul, I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
	And when my mind is free, you know a melody can move me
	And when I'm feelin' blue, the guitar's comin' through to soothe me
Thanks for the joy that you've given me, I want you to know, I believe in your song
And rhythm, and rhyme, and harmony, you help me along, makin' me strong
   Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul, I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
   Give me the beat boys and free my soul, I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
   Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul, I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
   Give me the beat boys and free my soul, I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

DRY BONES
Ezekiel cried "Them dry bones!" Ezekiel cried "Them dry bones!"
Ezekiel cried "Them dry bones! Now, hear the word of the Lord!"
	Ezekiel connected them dry bones, Ezekiel connected them dry bones
	Ezekiel connected them dry bones. Now, hear the word of the Lord!
Your toe bone connected to your foot bone, your foot bone connected to your ankle bone,

DU, DU LIEGST MIR IM HERZEN
Du, du, liegst mir im Herzen, du, du liegst mir im Sinn
Du, du, machst mir viel Schmerzen, weisst nicht wie gut ich dir bin
Ja, ja, ja, ja,  weisst nicht wie gut ich dir bin

So, so wie ich dich liebe, so, so liebe auch mich
Die, die zärtlichsten Triebe fühl' ich allein nur für dich
Ja, ja, ja, ja, fühl ' ich allein nur für dich

Doch, doch darf ich dir trauen dir, dir mit leichtem Sinn?
Du, du kannst auf mich bauen weisst ja wie gut ich dir bin
Ja, ja, ja, ja, weisst ja wie gut ich dir bin

Und, und wenn in der Ferne, mir, mir dein Bild erscheint,
Dann, dann wünscht ich so gerne, dass uns die Liebe vereint
Ja, ja, ja, ja, dass uns die Liebe vereint
Ja, ja, ja, ja, dass uns die Liebe vereint

DULCINEA
I have dreamed thee too long, never seen thee or touched thee, but known thee with all of my heart
Half a prayer, half a song, thou hast always  been near me, though we have been always apart.
	Dulcinea, Dulcinea, I see heaven when I see thee, Dulcinea
	And thy name is like a prayer an angel whispered, Dulcinea, Dulcinea
If I reach out to thee, do not tremble and shrink from the touch of my hand on thy hair
Let my fingers but see thou art warm and alive, and no phantom to fade in the air
	Dulcinea, Dulcinea, I have sought thee, sung thee, dreamed thee, Dulcinea
	Now I've found thee and the world shall know thy glory, Dulcinea, Dulcinea  (repeat last line)

EARLY MORNING RAIN
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
With an achin' in my heart, and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home, and I miss my darlin' so
In the early mornin' rain with no place to go.
	Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go
	But I'm stuck here on the grass where the cold winds blow
	Where the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
	There she goes my friend , Oh, she's rollin' now at last.
Hear the might engines roar, see the silver wing on high
She's away and westward bound, high above the clouds she'll fly
Where the mornin' rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flyin' o'er my home in about 3 hours' time.
	This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
	'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I can be
	You can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train
	So I'd best be on my way in the early mornin' rain
	You can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train
	So I'd best be on my way in the early mornin' rain.

EARTH ANGEL
Earth angel, earth angel, will you be mine, my darling, dear, love you all the time
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you

Earth angel, earth angel, the one I adore, love you forever, and evermore
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you
                 I fell for you, and I knew the vision of your love, loveliness
   	  I hope and I pray that some day
   	  I'll be the vision of your hap-happiness, oh......
Earth angel, earth angel, please be mine, my darling, dear, love you all the time
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you
A fool in love with you, a fool in love with you

EAST OF THE SUN
East of the sun and west of the moon, we'll build a dream-house of love, dear
Near to the sun in the day, near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way, dear, living on love and pale moonlight
Just you and I, forever and a day. Love will not die, we'll keep it that way
Up among the stars we'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear. East of the sun and west of the moon.

EAST VIRGINIA
Oh I was born in East Virginia, North Carolina I did roam
There I met a fair young maiden, her name and age,  I do not know
	Her hair it was a brightsome color, and her lips of ruby red
	On her breast she wore white lilies, there I longed to lay my head
Where in my heart you are my darlin', at my door you're welcome in
At my gate I need you, my darlin', if your love I could only win
	I'd rather be in some dark holler, where the sun refused to shine
	Than to see you be another man's darlin', and to know that you'll never be mine
Tho' in the night I'm dreamin' 'bout you, in the day I find no rest
Just the thought of you, my darlin', sends aching pain all through my breast
	Well, when I'm dead and in my coffin, with my feet turned toward the sun
	Come and sit beside me, darlin', come and think on the way you've done

EASY (LIKE SUNDAY MORNING)
Know it sounds funny, but I just can't stand the pain.
Girl, I'm leavin' you tomorrow
Seems to me, girl, you know I've done all I can.
You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed! Yeah!
	Ooh, that's why I'm easy, I'm easy like Sunday mornin'
	That's why I'm easy, I'm easy like Sunday mornin'!
Why in the world would anybody put chains on me?
I've paid my dues to make it
Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be.
I'm not happy when I try to fake it! No!
	Ooh, that's why I'm easy, I'm easy like Sunday mornin'
	That's why I'm easy, I'm easy like Sunday mornin'!
     I wanna be high, so  high. I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
     I wanna be free, just  me! Whoa, oh! Babe!
	That's why I'm easy, I'm easy like Sunday mornin', yeah
	That's why I'm easy, I'm easy like Sunday mornin'! whoa
	'Cause I'm easy, easy like Sunday mornin', yeah
	'Cause I'm easy, easy like Sunday mornin'

EASY LIVING
Living for you is easy living. It's easy to live, when you're in love
And I'm so in love, there's  nothing in life but you
	I never regret the years I'm giving, they're easy to give when you're in love
	I'm happy to do whatever I do for you
For you, maybe I'm a fool, but it's fun. People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
Darling, it's grand, they just don't understand
	Living for you is easy living. It's easy to live, when you're in love
	And I'm so in love, there's  nothing in life but you

EASY TO BE HARD
How can people be so heartless? How can people be so cruel?
     Easy to be hard, easy to be cold
How can people have no feelings? How can they ignore their friends?
     Easy to be proud, easy to say know.
	Especially people who care about strangers, who care about evil and social injustice
	Do you only care about the bleeding crowd? How about a needy friend? I need a friend
How can people be so heartless? You know I'm hung up on you
     Easy to be proud, easy to say no
	Especially people who care about strangers, who care about evil and social injustice
	Do you only care about the bleeding crowd? How about a needy friend? I need a friend
How can people be so heartless? How can people be so cruel?
     Easy to be proud, easy to say know. Easy to be cold, easy to say no
     Come on, easy to be mean, easy to say no, much too easy to say no

EBB TIDE
First the tide rushes in, plants a kiss on the shore,
Then rolls out to sea, and the sea is very still once more,
So I rush to your side, like the oncoming tide,
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?
	At last we're face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace,
	I can tell, I can feel, you are love, you are real,
	Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb, I'm at peace in the web of your arms.

EDDYSTONE LIGHT
My father was the keeper of the Eddystone Light. He courted a mermaid one fine night.
From this union there came three: a porgy and a porpoise and the other was me.
	Yo, ho, ho!  And the wind blows free!  Oh, for the life on the rolling sea!
Late one night, I was trimming the glim, while singing a verse from the evening hymn.
A voice from starboard shouted, "Ahoy," and there was me mother sitting on a buoy.
"What has become of my children three?" me mother she did ask of me.
"One was exhibited as a talking fish, the other was served on a chafing dish."
Then the phosphorus flashed in her seaweed hair, I looked a-gain and me mother wasn't there.
A voice came echoing out of the night, "The devil take the keeper of the Eddystone Light!" 

EDELWEISS
Edelweiss, Edelweiss, every morning you greet me.
Small and white, clean and bright, you look happy to meet me.
Blossom of snow may you bloom and grow, bloom and grow forever
Edelweiss, Edelweiss, bless my homeland forever.

EIGHT DAYS A WEEK
Ooh I need your love, babe, guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe, just like I need you.
Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
Ain't got nothin' but love, babe, eight days a week.

Love you every day, girl, you're always on my mind.
One thing I can say, girl, I love you all the time.
Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
Ain't got nothin' but love, babe, eight days a week.
	Eight days a week I lo-o-o-ove you,
	Eight days a week is not enough to show I care   (repeat 1st verse)

THE EIGHT DAYS OF CHANUKAH
On the first day of Chanukah, my true love gave to me:

A warm bagel topped with cream cheese
Two matzoh balls
Three golden latkes
Four pounds of corned beef
Five kosher dills
Six bubbes cooking
Seven rabbis dancing
Eight fiddlers fiddling


ELEANOR RIGBY
Ah, look at all the lonely people....Ah, look at all the lonely people.
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been, lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door, who is it for?
   	CHORUS:
All the lonely people, where do they all come from? All the lonely people, where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie, writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear, no one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there, what does he care?
	CHORUS
Eleanor Rigby, died in the church and was buried along with her name, nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave, no one was saved.
	CHORUS

ELENORE
You've got a thing about you, I just can't live without you, I really want you, Elenore, near me
Your looks intoxicate me, even though your folks hate me, there's no one like you, Elenore, really
     Elenore, gee, I think you're swell, and you really do me well, you're my pride and joy, et cetera
     Elenore, can I take the time to ask you to speak your mind? Tell me that you love me better
I really think you're groovy, let's go out to a movie. What do you say now, Elenore, can we?
They'll turn the lights way down low, maybe we won't watch the show.
I think I love you, Elenore, love me
     Elenore, gee, I think you're swell, and you really do me well, you're my pride and joy, et cetera
     Elenore, can I take the time to ask you to speak your mind? Tell me that you love me better
Elenore, gee, I think you're swell, ah-ha, Elenore, gee, I think you're swell, ah-ha.....ha

EL PASO
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso, I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina, music would play and Felina would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina, wicked and evil, while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden, I was in love but in vain, I could tell
     One night a wild young cowboy came in, wild as the West Texas wind
     Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing with wicked Felina, the girl that I loved, so, in anger
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden, down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat, the handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood there in silence, shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there, I had but one chance, and that was to run
     Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran, out where the horses were tied
     I caught a good one, it looked like it could run, up on its back and away I did ride, just as fast as I
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso, out to the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless, everything's gone in life, nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden, my love is stronger than my fear of death
     I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
     Maybe tomorrow, a bullet may find me, tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last, here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso, I can see Rosa's cantina below
My love is strong, and it pushes me onward, down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys, off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me, I have to make it to Rosa's back door
     Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel a deep burning pain in my side
     Though I am trying to stay in the saddle, I'm getting weary, unable to ride, but my love for
Felina is strong, and I rise where I've fallen, though I am weary I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle, I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere Felina has found me, kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for, one little kiss and Felina, goodbye

ELUSIVE BUTTERFLY
You might wake up some mornin' to the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise, you'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon, you may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears, you might hear footsteps running through an open meadow
     Don't be concerned, it will not harm you, it's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
     Across my dreams with nets of wonder, I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
You might have heard my footsteps echo softly in the distance, through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name, as I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin', through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there, that glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'
     Don't be concerned, it will not harm you, it's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
     Across my dreams with nets of wonder, I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

ELVIS MEDLEY
LOVE ME
Treat me like a fool, treat me mean and cruel, but  love me.
Break my faithful heart, tear it all apart, but love me. (won't you love me)
If you ever go,  darling, I'll be, oh, so lonely
I'll be sad and blue, cryin' over you, dear, always
	I would beg and steal (he would beg and steal) just to feel (yes, just to feel)
	Your heart (I want your heart) beating close to mine (so close to mine)
If you ever go, darling, I'll be, oh, so lonely
Beggin' on my knees, all I ask is please, please love me.  Ohhhhh  yeah!

HOUND DOG
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, cryin' all the time,
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, cryin' all the time,
	Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit, and you ain't no friend of mine!
Well, they said you was  high-class, but that was just a lie
Well, they said you was  high-class, but that was just a lie
 	Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit, and you ain't no friend of mine!   (Repeat 1st verse)

LOVE ME TENDER
Love me tender, love me sweet, never let me go.
You have made my life complete, and I love you so.
	Love me tender, love me true, all my dreams fulfill,
	For, my darling, I love you, and I always will.

DON'T BE CRUEL
You know I can be found, sitting home all alone
If you can't come around, at least please telephone.
	Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Baby, if I made you mad, somethin' I might have said
Please let's forget the past, the future looks bright ahead
	Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
  	I don't want no other love, baby, it's just you I'm thinking of.
 Let's walk up to the preacher, and let us say, "I do."
Then you'll know you have me, and I'll know that I have you.
	Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
	Why should we be apart, I really love you, baby,
	I just wanna be your teddy bear!  Oooh!

EMBRACEABLE YOU
Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you, embrace me, you irreplaceable you
Just one look at you, my heart grew tipsy in me. You and you  a-lone bring out the gypsy in me
I love all the many charms about you, above all, I want my arms about you
Don't be a naughty baby, come to papa, come to  papa  do, my sweet  embraceable you
Don't be a naughty baby, come to papa, come to  papa  do, my sweet  embraceable you

THE END OF THE WORLD
Why does the sun go on shining? Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't they know it's the end of the world, 'cause you don't love me any more?
Why do the birds go on singing? Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world? It ended when I lost your love.
	I wake up in the morning and I wonder why everything's the same as it was.
	I can't understand, no, I can't understand how life goes on the way it does.
Why does my heart go on beating? Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world? It ended when you said goodbye.

ENJOY YOURSELF
	Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think, enjoy yourself, while you're still  in the pink
	The years go by as quickly as a wink, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think.
You work and work for years and years, you're always on the go
You never take a minute off, too busy makin' dough.
Someday, you say, you'll have your fun when you're a millionaire
Imagine all the fun you'll have in your old rockin' chair.
	CHORUS
You're gonna take that ocean trip, no matter, come what may
You've got your reservations but you just can't get  away
Next year, for sure, you'll see the world, you'll really  get  around
But how far can you travel when you're six feet underground?
	CHORUS
You never go to nightclubs and you just don't care to dance;
You don't have time for silly things like moonlight and romance.
You only think of dollar bills tied neatly in a stack;
But when you kiss a dollar bill, it doesn't kiss you back!
	CHORUS


ERIE CANAL
I've got a mule her name is Sal, fifteen miles on the Erie Canal
She's a good ol' worker and a good ol' pal, fifteen miles on the Erie Canal
We've hauled some barges in our day, filled with lumber, coal and hay
And we know every inch of the way from Albany to Buffalo.

Low bridge, everybody down, low bridge 'cause we're coming to a town
And you'll always know your neighbor, you'll always know your pal
If you've ever navigated on the Erie Canal.

ESCAPE (PINA COLADA SONG)
I was tired of my lady, we'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleepin' I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns, there was this letter I read

If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga, if you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight in the dunes of the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me and escape

I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half bad

Yes, I like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's where we'll plan our escape

So I waited with high hopes and she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady and she said, "oh, it's you."
Then we laughed for a moment and I said, "I never knew."

That you like piña coladas and gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean and the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for, come with me and escape

If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga, if you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me and escape

EVERGREEN
Love, soft as an easy chair, love fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two, I have found with you
Like a rose, under the April snow, I was always certain love would grow
Love, ageless and evergreen, seldom seen by two
	You and I will make each night a first, every day a beginning
	Spirits rise, and their dance is unrehearsed
	They warm and excite us, 'cause we have the brightest love
Two lights that shine as one, morning glory and midnight sun
Time, we've learned to sail above, time won't change the meaning of
One love, ageless and ever, ever-green

EVERYBODY LOVES A CLOWN
Everybody loves a clown, so why don't you? Everybody laughs at the things that I say and do
They all laugh when they see me comin', but you don't laugh, you just go home runnin'
	Everybody loves a clown, so why can't you? A clown has feelings too
I joke around at a party when you are there.
But you don't laugh, you don't look, you just don't care
If you wonder why this clown is cryin', look a little closer, inside I'm dyin'
	It's not easy to be in love, you see, when you're a clown like me
I don't know how to say that I love you, 'cause you would smile and say 'tell a joke or two'
Yes, I'm a clown, but I don't want to be. Why can't you see the other side of me?
	Guess I'll be the guy who plays the part of a clown with a broken heart
Dreaming of your love, and not knowing where to start
Dreaming of your love, and not knowing where to start
Dreaming of your love, and not knowing where to start

EVERYBODY LOVES SOMEBODY SOMETIME
Everybody loves somebody sometime, everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me my sometime is now
Everybody finds somebody someplace, there's no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying my someplace is here
	If I had it in my power, I'd arrange for every girl to have your charms
	Then every minute, every hour, every boy would find what I found in your arms
Everybody loves somebody sometime, and, although my dream was overdue,
Your love made it well worth waiting for someone like you

EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE
Every breath you take, every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take, I'll be watching you

Every single day, every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay, I'll be watching you
     Oh, can't you see, you belong to me. How my poor heart aches, with every step you take
Every move you make, every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake, I'll  be watching you
         Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace, I dream at night, I can only see your face
         I look around, but it's you I can't replace, I feel so cold, and I long for your em-brace
         I keep crying baby, baby please,

     Oh, can't you see, you belong to me. How my poor heart aches, with every step you take
Every move you make, every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake, I'll  be watching you
Every move you make, every step you take, I'll be watching you
I'll be watching you,                I'll be watching you                 (Repeat and fade)

EVERYDAY
Every day it's a-gettin' closer, going faster than a roller coaster,
Love like yours will truly come my way
	Every day seems a little longer, every way love's a little stronger
	Come what may, do you ever long for true love from me?
Every day it's a-gettin' closer, going faster than a roller coaster,
Love like yours will truly come my way

EVERYDAY PEOPLE
Sometimes I'm right, and I can be wrong. My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then, makes no difference what group I'm in
	I am everyday people, yeah yeah
     There is a blue one who can't accept the green one
     For living with a fat one , trying to be a skinny one
	And different strokes for different folks, and so on and so on and scooby dooby doo
	Oh, sha sha, we got to live together
I am no better, and neither are you. We are the same, whatever we do
You love me, you hate me, you know me, and then, you can't figure out the bag I'm in
	I am everyday people, yeah yeah
There is a long hair that doesn't like the short hair
For bein' such a rich one that will not help the poor one
	And different strokes for different folks, and so on and so on and scooby dooby doo
	Oh, sha sha, we got to live together
     There is a yellow one that won't accept the black one
     That won't accept the red one that won't accept the white one

Every day I love you more and more, more and more and more

Every day with you girl is sweeter than the day before
Every day I love you more and more, more and more and more

	'Cause every day with you girl, is sweeter than the day before

But tonight I just want stay in and be with you, and be with you
    Oo oo....................,  Believe me, momma. Oo oo....................,  And be with you!

EVERYONE'S GONE TO THE MOON
Streets full of people, all alone. Roads full of houses, never home
Church full of singing, out of tune. Everyone's gone to the moon

Eyes full of sorrow, never wet. Hands full of money, all in debt
Sun coming out in the middle of June. Everyone's gone to the moon
	Long time ago, life had begun, everyone went to the sun
Hearts full of motors, painted green. Mouths full of chocolate-covered cream
Arms that can only lift a spoon. Everyone's gone to the moon
Everyone's gone to the moon, everyone's gone to the moon

EVERYTHING
You're a falling star, you're the get-away car, you're the line in the sand when I go too far.
You're the swimming pool on an August day, and you're the perfect thing to say.

And you play it coy, but it's kinda cute, ah, when you smile at me, you know exactly what you do.
Baby, don't pretend that you don't know it's true, 'cause you can see it when I look at you.
     And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times, it's you, it's you, you make me sing.
     You're every line, you're every word, you're everything.
You're a carousel, you're a wishing well, and you light me up, when you ring my bell.
You're a mystery, you're from outer space, you're every minute of every day.

And I can't believe, uh, that I'm your man, and I get to kiss you, baby, just because I can.
Whatever comes our way, ah, we'll see it through, and you know that's what our love can do.
     And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times, it's you, it's you, you make me sing.
     You're every line, you're every word, you're everything.
	So, la, la, la, la, la, la, la....So, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
     And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times, it's you, it's you, you make me sing.
     You're every line, you're every word, you're everything.
	You're every song, and I sing along, 'cause you're my everything. Yeah, yeah.
	So, la, la, la, la, la, la, la....So, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

EVERYTHING HAPPENS TO ME
	Black cats creep across my path until I'm almost mad
	I must have roused the Devil's wrath 'cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party but the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life just catchin' colds and missin' trains
	Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing, I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace, my partner always trumps
I guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps
	Everything happens to me
       At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
       That love would turn the trick to end despair
       But now I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
       So I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned, sent an Air Mail Special, too
Your answer was "Goodbye", there was even postage due
I fell in love just once and then it had to be with you
   	Everything happens to me
I've never drawn a sweepstake or a bank night at a show
I thought perhaps this time I'd won but Lady Luck said, "No"
And though it breaks my heart I'm not surprised to see you go
	Everything happens to me...... Everything happens to me

EVERYTHING I OWN
You sheltered me from harm, kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me, set me free, set me free
The finest years I ever knew were all the years I had with you
	And I would give anything I own, give up my life, my heart, my home
	I would give everything I own, just to have you back again
You taught me how to love, what it's of, what it's of
You never said too much, but still you showed the way, and I knew from watching you
Nobody else could ever know the part of me that can't let go
	And I would give anything I own, give up my life, my heart, my home
	I would give everything I own, just to have you back again
     Is there someone you know, you're loving them so, but taking them all for granted
     You may lose them one day, someone takes them away
     And they don't hear the words you long to say
	And I would give anything I own, give up my life, my heart, my home
	I would give everything I own, just to have you back again, just to touch you once again

EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL
	Everything is beautiful in its own way,
	Like a starry summer night or a snow-covered winter's day
	And everybody's beautiful in their own way,
	Under God's heaven, the world's gonna find a way
There is none so blind as he who will not see
We must not close our minds, we must let our thoughts be free

For every hour that passes by, you know the world gets a little bit older
It's time to realize that beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder
	And everything is beautiful in its own way
	Like a starry summer night on a snow-covered winter's day, ah, sing it, children
	And everybody's beautiful in their own way,
	Under God's heaven, the world's gonna find a way
We shouldn't care about the length of his hair, or the color of his skin
Don't worry about what shows from without, but the love that lives within

We're gonna get it all together now, everything's gonna work out fine
Just take a little time to look on the good side, my friend, straighten it out in your mind
	And everything is beautiful in its own way
	Like a starry summer night on a snow-covered winter's day, sing it, children
	And everybody's beautiful in their own way,
	Under God's heaven, the world's gonna find a way
	Under God's heaven, the world's gonna find a way

EVERYTHING MUST CHANGE
Everything must change, nothing stays the same. Everyone will change, no one stays the same
The young become the old, and mysteries do unfold,
'Cause that's the way of time, nothing and no one goes unchanged
	There are not many things in life you can be sure of
	Except rain comes from the clouds, sun lights up the sky, and hummingbirds do fly
Winter turns to spring, a wounded heart will heal
But never much too soon, yes, everything must change.
The young become the old, and mysteries do unfold,
'Cause that's the way of time, nothing and no one goes unchanged
	There are not many things in life you can be sure of
	Except rain comes from the clouds, sun lights up the sky, and hummingbirds do fly
       	Rain comes from the clouds, sun lights up the sky, and butterflies do fly
       	Rain comes from the clouds, sun lights up the sky, and music, music makes me cry

EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN
When trumpets were mellow and every gal only had one fellow
No need to remember when, 'cause everything old is new again  (repeat "hook")
Long Island jazz-age party,   waiter bring us some more Baccardi
Order now what they ordered then, 'cause everything  old is new again  (repeat)
	 Get out your white suit, your tap shoes and tails.
	  Let's go backwards when forward fails
	  And movie stars you thought were long dead, now are framed beside your bed
Don't throw the past away, You might need it some rainy day
Dreams can come true again, When every-thing  old is new again  (repeat)
	   Get out your white suit, your tap shoes and tails.
	   Let's go backwards when forward fails
	   Leave Greta Garbo alone, be a movie star on your own
And don't throw the past away, you might need it some rainy day
Dreams can come true again, When everything old is new again
When everything old is new again

EVERY TIME WE SAY GOODBYE
Ev'ry time we say goodbye, I die a little. Ev'ry time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know, think so little of me they allow you to go.
When you're near there's such an air of spring about it,
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it.
There's no love song finer,But how strange the change from major to minor
Ev'ry time we say good - bye.

EXACTLY LIKE YOU
I know why I've waited, know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone exactly like you
Why should we spend money on a show or two,
No one does those love scenes exactly like you
You make me feel so grand, I want to hand the world to you
You seem to understand each foolish little scheme I'm scheming, dream I'm dreaming
Now I know why mother taught me to be true
She meant me for someone exactly like you.

EXODUS THEME
This land is mine, God gave this land to me. This brave and ancient land to me
And when the morning sun reveals her hills and plain
Then I see a land where children can run free

So take my hand, and walk this land with me, and walk this lovely land with me
Though I am just a man, when you are by my side
With the help of God, I know I can be strong
	Though I am just a man, when you are by my side
	With the help of God, I know I can be strong
To make this land our home, if I must fight, I'll fight to make this land our own
Until I die, this land is mine

EYE OF THE TIGER
Risin' up, back on the street, did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet, just a man and his will to survive
So many times, it happens too fast, you trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past, you must fight just to keep them alive
	It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
	Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
	And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
	And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger
Face to face, out in the heat, hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
They stack the odds 'till we take to the street, for the kill with the skill to survive
	It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
	Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
	And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
	And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger
Risin' up, straight to the top, had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop, just a man and his will to survive
	It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
	Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
	And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
	And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger
     The eye of the tiger  (X3)

FALLING IN LOVE WITH LOVE
Falling in love with love is falling for make-be-lieve; falling in love with love is playing the fool.
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy; learning to trust is just for children in school.

I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full, I was unwise with eyes un-able to see.
I fell in love with love, with love ever-lasting, but love  fell  out with  me.

FAR AWAY PLACES
Far away places with strange-sounding names, far away over the sea
Those far away places with their strange-sounding names are callin', callin' me.
Goin' to China, or maybe Si-am, I want to see for my-self
Those far away places I've been reading a-bout in a book that I took from the shelf.
	I start gettin' restless when-ever I hear the whistle of a train.
	I pray for the day I can get underway and look for those castles in Spain.
They call me a dreamer, well maybe I am, but I know that I'm yearnin' to see
Those far away places with their strange-sounding names that are callin', callin' me.
Those far away places with their strange-sounding names that are callin', callin' me.

FAREWELL
Oh it's fare thee well my darlin' true, I'm leavin' the first hour of the morn.
I'm bound off for the bay of Mexico, or maybe the coast of Californ.
	So it's fare thee well my own true love, we'll meet another day, another time.
	It's not the leavin' that's grievin' me, but my true love who's bound to stay behind.
Oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hard, the rain. she's turnin' into hail.
I still might strike it lucky on a highway goin' west, though I'm travelin' on a lonesome trail.
	So it's fare thee well ....
I will tell you of the laughter and of troubles, be they someone else's or my own.
With my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high, I will travel unnoticed and unknown.
	So it's fare thee well ....

FAR FROM THE HOME I LOVE
How can I hope to make you understand why I do, what I do,
Why I must travel to a distant land, far from the home I love?
Once I was happily content to be as I was, where I was
Close to the people who are close to me, here in the home I love
	Who could see that a man would come, who would change the shapes of my dreams?
	Helpless, now, I stand with him, watching older dreams grow dim.
Oh, what a melancholy choice this is, wanting home, wanting him,
Closing my heart to every hope but his, leaving the home I love.

There where my heart has settled long ago, I must go, I must go.
Who could imagine I'd be wandering so, far from the home I love?
Yet, there with my love, I'm home.

FARMER'S SONG
Dusty old farmer out working your fields, hanging down over  your tractor wheels
The sun beatin' down turns the red paint to orange and rusty old patches of steel
There's no farmer songs on that car radio, just cowboys, truck drivers and pain
Well this is my way to say thanks for the meal, and I hope there's no shortage of rain
     Straw hat and old dirty hankies, moppin' a face like a shoe
     Thanks for the meal here's a song that is real, from a kid from the city to you
The combines gang up, take most of the bread, things just ain't like they used to be
Though your kids are out after the Am-erican dream and they're workin in big factor-ies
 If  I come by, when you're out in the sun, can I wave at you just like a friend
These days when everyone's taking so much, there's somebody giving back in
	Straw hat and old dirty hankies.......

FASCINATING RHYTHM
Fascinating rhythm, you've got me on the go, fascinating rhythm, I'm  all a-quiver
What a mess you're making, the neighbors want to know why I'm always shaking just like a fliver.
	Each morning I get up with the sun
	To find at night no work has been done- I know that
Once it didn't matter but now you're doing wrong. When you start to patter I'm so unhappy
Won't you take a day off? Decide to run along somewhere far away off, and make it snappy!
Oh how I long to be      the man I used to be!
Fascinating rhythm, oh, won't you stop picking on me!

FASCINATION
It was fascination, I know, and it might have ended right there at the start
Just a passing glance, just a brief romance, and I might have gone on my way empty-hearted

It was fascination, I know, seeing you alone with the moonlight above
Then I touched your hand, and that moment I kissed you, fascination turned to love

FERDINAND THE BULL
Oh there once lived a bull, a magnificent bull, in a pasture near old Barcelona
He would romp and he'd play through the flowers all day, till he smelled just like eau de cologne-a
He was gentle and kind, and his moo was refined, which the rest of the bulls all resented
For, when he'd start to moo, in a moment or two, he'd have all the cows discontented
	Ferdinand, Ferdinand the bull with the delicate ego
	Ferdinand, Ferdinand, the heifers all called him "amigo"
	Ferdinand, Ferdinand he'd curtsey and greet them politely
	Now, he knew how to tango and dance the fandango,
      	But he never learned to fight
Now there once lived a bee, a magnificent bee, who was feeling so chock full of vigor
That he got out of hand, and he stung Ferdinand with his sharp little thingamajigger
Ferdinand was so hurt, he was pawing the dirt, when a bold picador chanced to sight him
Oh! the picador cried, "As a matter of pride, I'll get my stiletto and fight him!"
	Ferdinand, Ferdinand, he smiled when the picador faced him,
	Ferdinand, Ferdinand, he winked, and the picador chased him
	Ferdinand, Ferdinand, he viewed the occasion so lightly
	When the picador missed him, why, Ferdinand kissed him,
	For he never learned how to fight,

　　　　...., The bull with the dream-like demeanor.......,he'd faint in the bullfight arena
	Ferdinand, Ferdinand, when he faced those bullfighters nightly
	He would look at their features, then hide in the bleachers
	For he never learned to fight

	Ferdinand, Ferdinand, the toreadors tried to spear him
	Ferdinand, Ferdinand, the chased him, but couldn't get near him
	Female hands from the stands would toss a few posies politely
	Each night poor old Ferdie would give them a birdie, for he never learned to fight,
	No, he never learned to fight!

FIDDLIN' DAN
Many years ago, in Arkansas, a stranger told this story to my ma
And many is the time she said to me, "Seems just as true, just as true can be!"
     There was once in the hills quite a music-lovin' man, known far and wide as Fiddlin' Dan
     He could play any tune, he could holler any call, with fiddlin' so true, he could play them all
One day as Fiddlin' Dan went out to play, he spied a grizzly bear standin' in his way
He couldn't fly away, he had no gun, couldn't climb a tree, and he was scared to run
     Said the bear, with a growl, as he shook a mighty paw, "You, Fiddlin' Dan from Arkansas,
     I'll leave you alone, if you play a little tune, to organize a dance in the light of the moon."
So, Danny put his fiddle under his chin, and he drew his bow, and the music did begin
From all the country 'round the critters ran, to join in the dance, played by Fiddlin' Dan
The big black bear brought the little porcupine, the ol' bobcat, she danced so fine
And they danced through the night, every fiddle, every step,
And somewhere in the hills, I bet they're fiddlin' yet!

50 WAYS TO LEAVE YOUR LOVER
The problem is all inside your head, she said to me. The answer is easy, if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free, there must be 50 ways to leave your lover
She said it's really not my habit to intrude,
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself, at the risk of being crude
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover, 50 ways to leave your lover
	You just slip out the back, Jack, make a new plan, Stan
	You don't need to be coy, Roy, just listen to me
	Hop on the bus, Gus, you don't need to discuss much
	Just drop off the key, Lee, and get yourself free
She said it grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again
I said, I appreciate that, and would you please explain about the 50 ways
She said, why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me, and I realized she probably was right
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover, 50 ways to leave your lover
	You just slip out the back, Jack, make a new plan, Stan
	You don't need to be coy, Roy, just listen to me
	Hop on the bus, Gus, you don't need to discuss much
	Just drop off the key, Lee, and get yourself free

59th STREET BRIDGE SONG
Slow down, you move too fast, you got to make the morning last
Just kickin' down the cobble-stones, lookin' for fun and feelin' groovy
	Ba da da da da da da, feelin' groovy
Hello, lamppost, what'cha knowin'? I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain't'cha got no rhymes for me? Doot-in doo-doo, feelin' groovy
	Ba da da da da da da, feelin' groovy
I got no deeds to do, no promises to keep, I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me.  Life, I love you, all is groovy
	Ba da da da da da da, feelin' groovy
	Ba da da da da da da da da da da  (X3)
	Ba da da da da da da, feelin' groovy

FINE AND DANDY
Gee, it's all fine and dandy, sugar candy, when I've got you
Then I only see the sunny side, even trouble has its funny side
When you're gone, Sugar Candy, I get so lonesome, I get so blue
When you're handy, it's fine and dandy, but when you're gone what can I do?

FIRE AND RAIN
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Susanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to.
	I've seen fire and I've seen rain, I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
	I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend. But I always thought that I'd see you again
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus, you gotta help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand. I won't make it any other way
	I've seen fire......
Been walkin' my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
	I've seen fire......

THE FIRST TIME EVER I SAW YOUR FACE
The first time ever I saw your face, I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave,  to the dark and the empty skies, my love
To the dark and the empty skies

The first time ever I kissed your mouth, I felt the earth move in my hand
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird. that was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command

The first time ever I lay with you, and felt your heart beat close to mine
I knew our joy would fill the earth, and last 'til the end of time, my love
And last 'til the end of time, my love

FIVE FOOT TWO, EYES OF BLUE
Five foot two, eyes of blue, but, oh, what those five feet could do! Has anybody seen my gal?
Turned up nose, turned down hose, flapper, yes sir, one of those! Has anybody seen my gal?
Now if you run into a five foot two covered with fur,
Diamond rings, and all those things, betcha life it isn't her!
But could she love, could she woo, could she, could she, could she coo!
Has anybody seen my, anybody seen my, has anybody seen my gal?

FIVE HUNDRED MILES
If you miss the train I'm on, you will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles, a hundred miles, a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

Lord, I'm one, Lord, I'm two, Lord, I'm three, Lord, I'm four
Lord, I'm five hundred miles from my home
Five hundred miles, five hundred miles, five hundred miles, five hundred miles
Lord, I'm five hundred miles from my home

Not a shirt on my back, not a penny to my name
Lord, I can't go a-home this a-way
This a-away, this a-way, this a-way, this a-way
Lord, I can't go a-home this a-way

If you miss the train I'm on, you will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

FIVE O'CLOCK WORLD
Up every morning just to keep a job, I gotta fight my way through the hustlin' mob
Sounds of the city poundin' in my brain, while another day goes down the drain
	But it's a five o'clock world when the whistle blows, no one owns a piece of my time
	And there's a five o'clock me inside my clothes, thinkin' that the world looks fine, yeah
	   Ada-ladee-hee, hee, yeah
Tradin' my time for the pay I get, livin' on money that I ain't made yet
Gotta keep goin', gotta make my way, but I live for the end of the day
	'Cause it's a five o'clock world when the whistle blows, no one owns a piece of my time
	And there's a long-haired girl who waits, I know, to ease my troubled mind, yeah
	   Ada-ladee-hee, hee, yeah
In the shelter of her arms every-thing's OK, she talks and the world goes slippin' a-way (it slips away)
And I know the reason I can still go on, when every other reason is gone
	In my five o'clock world she waits for me,	nothing else matters at all
	'Cause every time my baby smiles at me,	I know that its all worth-while, yeah
	   Ada-ladee-hee, hee, yeah

FIXING A HOLE
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in and stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door and kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
	And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right where I belong, I'm right where I belong
	See the people standing there who disagree, and never win,
	And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting the room in a colorful way and when my mind is wandering,
There I will go whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
	And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right where I belong,
	I'm right where I belong
	Silly people run around, they worry me and never ask me
	Why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things that weren't important yesterday
And I still go whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
	I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in and stops my mind from wandering
	Where it will go whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
	I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in   (repeat and fade)

FLY AWAY
All of her days have gone soft and cloudy, all of her dreams have gone dry.
All of her nights have gone sad and shady, she's getting ready to fly.
Fly away, fly away, fly away .

Life in the city can make you crazy for sounds of the sand and the sea.
Life in a high-rise can make you hungry for things that you can't even see.
Fly away, fly away, fly away.
	In this whole world there's nobody as lonely as she,
	There's nowhere to go and there's nowhere that she'd rather be.
She's looking for lovers and children playing, she's looking for signs of the spring.
She listens for laughter and sounds of dancing, she listens for any old thing.
Fly away, fly away, fly away .
	In this whole world there's nobody as lonely as she,
	There's nowhere to go and there's nowhere that she'd rather be.
All of her days have gone soft and cloudy, all of her dreams have gone dry.
All of her nights have gone sad and shady, She's getting ready to fly.
Fly away, fly away, fly away, fly away, fly away, fly away

FLY ME TO THE MOON
Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars,
Let me see what Spring is like on Jupiter and Mars;
In other words, hold my hand; in other words, darling, kiss me.

Fill my heart with song, and let me sing for ever more;
You are all I long for, all I worship and adore.
In other words, please be true; in other words, I love you.

A FOGGY DAY
I was a stranger in the city.   Out of town were the people I knew
I had the feeling of self-pity. What to do? What to do? What to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue.
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London town had me low and it had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm, the British museum had lost its charm
How long, I wondered, could this thing last? But the age of miracles hadn't passed.
For suddenly I saw you there, and in foggy London town the sun was shining everywhere.

It's by far the hardest thing I've ever done, to be so in love with you, and so alone
     Follow me where I go, what I do, and who I know.  Make it part of you to be a part of me
     Follow me up and down, all the way, and all around. Take my hand, and say you'll follow me
It's long been on my mind, you know, it's been a long, long time
I've tried to find the way that I can make you understand
The way I feel about you, and just how much I need you
To be there where I can talk to you, when there's no one else around
     Follow me where I go, what I do, and who I know.  Make it part of you to be a part of me
     Follow me up and down, all the way, and all around. Take my hand, and say you'll follow me
You see, I'd like to share my life with you, and show you things I've seen
Places that I'm going to, places where I've been
To have you there beside me, and never be alone
And all the time that you're with me, we will be at home
     Follow me where I go, what I do, and who I know.  Make it part of you to be a part of me
     Follow me up and down, all the way, and all around. Take my hand, and say you'll follow me

FOLLOW THE DRINKING GOURD
	Follow the drinking gourd, follow the drinking gourd
For the old man is a waitin' for to carry you to freedom
Follow the drinking gourd.
When the sun comes up and the first quail calls follow the drinking gourd
For the old man is a waitin' for to carry you to freedom
Follow the drinking gourd.
	Chorus
The river bank will make a mighty good road, the dead trees will show you the way
With your left foot, your peg foot, travelin' on,
Follow the drinking gourd.
	Chorus
The river ends between two hills, follow the drinking gourd
There's another river on the other side,
Follow the drinking gourd.
	Chorus X2

FOOLED AROUND AND FELL IN LOVE
I must have been through 'bout a million girls, I'd love 'em and I'd leave 'em alone
I didn't care how much they cried, no sir, their tears left me cold as a stone
	But then I fooled around and fell in love, I fooled around and fell in love
	I fooled around and fell in love, I fooled around and fell in love
It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked, I'd get out my book and write down her name
But when the grass got a little greener on the other side, I'd just tear out that page
	But then I fooled around and fell in love, I fooled around and fell in love
	I fooled around and fell in love, I fooled around and fell in love
Free, on my own, that's the way I used to be, but, since I met you baby, love's got a hold on me
          (Fooled around and fell in love)
          (Fooled around and fell in love)
          (Fooled around and fell in love)

FOOL ON THE HILL
Day after day, alone on the hill, the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
Nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool, and he never gives an answer
	But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down,
	And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round
Well on the way, his head in a cloud, the man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
Nobody ever hears him, or the sound he appears to make, and he never seems to notice
	But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down,
	And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round
Nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do, and he never shows his feelings
	But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down,
	And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round
But he never listens to them, he knows that they're the fool, and they don't like him
	But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down,
	And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round

A FOOL SUCH AS I
Now and then, there's a fool such as I
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye, don't be angry with me should I cry
Now when you're gone, yet I'll dream a little dream as years go by
Now and then, there's a fool such as I
	Now and then, there's a fool such as I am over you
	You taught me how to love and now
	You say that we are through
I'm a fool but I'll love you dear until the day I die
Now and then, there's a fool such as I
Now and then, there's a fool such as I
Now and then, there's a fool such as I

FOOLS RUSH IN
	"Romance is a game for fools," I used to say, a game I thought I'd never play
	"Romance is a game for fools,"I said and grinned
	Then you passed by, and here am I, throwing caution to the wind
Fools rush in, where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see  the danger there, if there's a chance for me, then I don't care.
Fools rush in, where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love,  so how are they to know?.
When we met, I felt my life begin, so open up your heart and let this fool rush in.

FOR ALL WE KNOW
For all we know, we may never meet again. Before you go, make this moment sweet again
We won't say "Good night" until the last minute, I'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it
For all we know, this may only be a dream. We come and go like a ripple on a stream
So love me tonight, tomorrow was made for some. Tomorrow may never come for all we know
So love me tonight, tomorrow was made for some. Tomorrow may never come for all we know

FOR BABY (FOR BOBBY)
I'll walk in the rain by your side, I'll cling to the warmth of your hand
I'll do anything to keep you satisfied, I'll love you more than anybody can
	And the wind will whisper your name to me, little birds will sing along in time
	Leaves will bow down when you walk by, and morning bells will chime
I'll be there when you're feelin' down, to kiss away the tears if you cry
I'll share with you all the happiness I've found, a reflection of the love in your eyes
	And I'll sing you the songs of the rainbow,  I'll whisper of the joy that is mine
	And leaves will bow down when you walk by, and morning bells will chime
I'll walk in the rain by your side, I'll cling to the warmth of your tiny hand
I'll do anything to help you understand, I'll love you more than anybody can
	And the wind will whisper your name to me, little birds will sing along in time
	Leaves will bow down when you walk by, and morning bells will chime

FOREVER YOUNG
May the good Lord be with you down every road you roam
And may sunshine and happiness surround you when you're far from home
And may you grow to be proud, dignified and true
And do unto others, as you'd have done to you
Be courageous and be brave, and in my heart you'll always stay
	Forever Young, (Forever Young), Forever Young, (Forever Young)
May good fortune be with you, may your guiding light be strong
Build a stairway to heaven with a prince or a vagabond
And may you never love in vain, and in my heart you will remain
	Forever Young, (Forever Young), Forever Young, (Forever Young), Forever Young, Forever Young
And when you finally fly away I'll be hoping that I served you well
For all the wisdom of a lifetime, no one can ever tell
But whatever road you choose I'm right behind you, win or lose
	Forever Young, (Forever Young), Forever Young, (Forever Young)
	Forever Young, Forever Young,   For... Forever Young, Forever Young

FOR FREE
I slept last night in a good hotel, I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town, and the children let out from the schools
I was standing on a noisy corner, waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood, and he played real good, on his clarinet for free
	Now me I play for fortune and those velvet curtain calls
	I've got a black limousine and two gentlemen, escorting me to the halls
	And I play if you have the money, or if you're a friend to me
	But the one man band by the quick lunch stand, he was playing real good for free
Nobody stopped to hear him, though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never  been on their T.V., so they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song, maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain as the signal changed, he was playing real good for free

FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW
For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow,
For he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.
	Which nobody can deny, which nobody can deny.
For he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.

For she's a jolly good lassie, for she's a jolly good lassie,
For she's a jolly good lassie, which nobody can deny.
	Which nobody can deny, which nobody can deny.
For she's a jolly good lassie, which nobody can deny.

FOR ME AND MY GAL
The bells are ringing for me and my gal
The birds are singing for me and my gal
Everybody's been knowing to a wedding they're going
And for weeks they've been sewing
Every Susie and Sal

They're congregating for me and my gal
The parson's waiting for me and my gal
And someday (SLOWER) we're gonna build a little home for two
Or three or four or more
In Loveland for me and my gal (for me and my gal)

FOR NO ONE
The day breaks, your mind aches, you find that all her words of kindness linger on
     When she no longer needs you
She wakes up, she makes up, she takes her time, and doesn't feel she has to hurry
     She no longer needs you
	And in her eyes you see nothing, no sign of love behind the tears
	Cried for no one, a love that should have lasted years
You want her, you need her, and yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
     You think she needs you
	And in her eyes you see nothing, no sign of love behind the tears
	Cried for no one, a love that should have lasted years
You stay home, she goes out, she says that long ago she knew someone, but now he's gone
     She doesn't need him
The day breaks, your mind aches, there will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
     You won't forget her
	And in her eyes you see nothing, no sign of love behind the tears
	Cried for no one, a love that should have lasted years

FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE
For once in my life I have someone who needs me, someone I've needed so long
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me, somehow I know I'll be strong
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of, long before I knew
Someone warm like you would make my dream come true
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me, not like it hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me, I'm not alone anymore
For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me

FOR SENTIMENTAL REASONS
I love you for sentimental reasons, I hope you do believe me,  I`ll give you my heart
I love you, and you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me, and say we`ll never part
  	I think of you every morning, dream of you every  night
	Darling, I`m never lonely, 	whenever you're in sight
I  love  you for sentimental reasons, I hope you do believe me, I`ve given you my heart

FOR THE GOOD TIMES
Don't look so sad. I know it's over, but life goes on and this world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning
	Lay your head upon my pillow, hold your warm and tender body close to mine
	Hear the whisper of the raindrops, blowing soft against the window
	And make believe you love me one more time....for the good times
I'll get along, you'll find another, and I'll be here if you should find you ever need me.
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever,
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me.
	Lay your head upon my pillow, hold your warm and tender body close to mine
	Hear the whisper of the raindrops, blow softly against my window
	Make believe you love me one more time....for the good times, for the good times

FOR THE LONGEST TIME
	Woa,  woa woa woa, for the longest time. Woa, woa woa for the longest
If you said goodbye to me tonight, there would still be music left to write.
What else could I do? I'm so inspired by you. That hasn't happened for the longest time.
Once I  thought my innocence was gone. Now I know that happiness goes on.
That's where you found me, when you put your arms around me.
I haven't been there for the longest time.
	Woa,  woa woa woa, for the longest time. Woa, woa woa for the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall. And the greatest miracle of all,
Is how I need you, and how you  needed me too. That hasn't happened for the longest time.
	Maybe this won't last very long, but you feel so right, and I could be wrong.
	Maybe I've been hoping too hard, but I've gone this far and it's more than I hoped for
Who knows how much further we'll go on.  Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone.
 I'll take my chances,  I forgot how nice romance is. I haven't been there for the longest time.
	I had second thoughts at the start.  I said to myself hold on to your heart.
	Now I know the woman that you are. You're wonderful so far and it's more than I hoped for.
I don't care what consequence it brings. I have been a fool for lesser things.
I want you so bad, I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time.
Woa,  woa woa woa, for the longest time. Woa, woa woa for the longest time

FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH
There's somethin' happenin' here. What it is ain't exactly clear.
There's a man with a gun over there, a-tellin' me I've got to beware.
	I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound?
	Everybody look what's goin' down.
There's battle lines bein' drawn. Nobody's right if everybody's wrong.
Young people speakin' their minds, a-gettin' so much resistance from behind.
	It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound?
	Everybody look what's goin' down.
What a field day for the heat.  A thousand people in the street
Singin' songs and a-carryin' signs, mostly say hooray for our side.
	It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound?
	Everybody look what's goin' down.
Paranoia strikes deep. Into your life it will creep.
It starts when you're always afraid. Step out of line, the men come and take you away.
	You better stop, hey, what's that sound? 	Everybody look what's goin' ....
	You better stop, now, what's that sound? 	Everybody look what's goin' ....
	You better stop, children, what's that sound? Everybody look what's goin' ....  (fade)

FOUR STRONG WINDS
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may.
But our good times, all are gone, and I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.

Think I'll go down to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall,
Got some friends that I can go to workin' for.
Still I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more.
  	(Four Strong Winds.....)
If I get there 'fore the snow flies, and if things are goin' good
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare.
But by then it will be winter, there ain't too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold, way out there.
	(Four Strong Winds.....)


THE FOX (WENT OUT ON A CHILLY NIGHT)
Oh, the fox went out on a chilly night, prayed for the moon to give him light
He had many a mile to go that night, before he reached the town-o, town-o, town-o
Many a mile to go that night before he reached the town-o

Well, he ran till he come to a  great big pen, where the ducks and the geese were kept therein
He said, "A couple of you are gonna grease my chin, before I leave this town, town-o, town-o"
"A couple of you are gonna grease my chin, before I leave this town-o"

He grabbed the gray goose by the neck, slung a duck across his back
And he didn't mind the quack, quack, quack, or the legs all danglin' down-o, down-o, down-o
He didn't mind the quack, quack, quack, or the legs all danglin' down-o

Then old mother Flipper Flopper jumped out of bed, out to the window where she cocked her head
Cryin', "John, John, the gray goose is gone, and the fox is on the town-o, town-o, town-o
John, John, the gray goose is gone and the fox is on the town-o

John, he ran to the top of the hill, blowed his horn, both loud and shrill
The fox he said, "I better flee with my kill, for they'll soon be on my trail-o, trail-o, trail-o"
The fox he said, "I better flee with my kill, for they'll soon be on my trail-o"

Well, he ran till he come to his cozy den, there were the little ones, eight, nine, ten
Cryin', "Daddy, daddy, better go back again, for it must be a mighty fine town-o, town-o, town-o
Daddy, daddy, better go back again, for it must be a mighty fine town-o"

Then the fox and his wife, without any strife, cut up the goose with a carving knife
They never had such a supper in their life, and the little ones chewed on the bones-o, bones-o, bones-o
They never had such a supper in their life, and the little ones chewed on the bones-o!

(NEW) FRANKIE AND JOHNNY BLUES
Well, Frankie, she was a fine looking woman, had a man named Johnny
And she loved him, well she laid down a hundred for a suit of clothes
Don't you see them, just a walkin' all alone down along Canal Street
Frankie loved Johnny, Lord, everybody knows.
	Well, Frankie, she came home one evening, just a little bit early
	And she thought, "I better stop at the corner for a bottle of beer"
	Well she sat down and she told her story to the fat bartender
	"Tell me, fat daddy, has my Johnny man been here?"
Well, Frankie, I'm a terrible sorry you asked me that question
You know I'm a-bout as honest as a man can be.
Saw your Johnny, he was a-walkin down Main, feelin' no pain
Slippin' and a slidin' with a girl named Annabelle Lee.
	Well, Frankie, sh'said "Oh no no that can't be so
	I know, I know my candy man won't treat me wrong
	Well, she sat there, she had a few more beers, she shed a few more tears.
	"I'm tired of getting' that mean ol' run a-round."
Well, Frankie, she went out in a taxi at the corner of Main Sreet
And she looked up, she saw Johnny and Annabelle swingin' there.
Well she pulled out, and with a deadly aim, and with a forty-four pistol
Shot that Johnny in the middle of his big affair.
	Well, Frankie, she was a fine lookin' woman, had a man named Johnny
	And she loved him, well she laid down a hundred for a suit of clothes
	Don't you see them, just a-walkin' all alown down along Canal Street
	Frankie loved Johnny, Lord everybody knows
	Frankie loved Johnny Lord, everybody knows.

FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION
If you turn me down once more, I'll join the French Foreign Legion
Bet you, they would welcome me, with open arms
First you love me, yes; then you love me, no
I don't know where I stand

Do we march together down the isle
Or do I march that desert sand
If you think I won't find romance, in the French Foreign Legion
Think about that uniform with all its charm
	Just one more time are you gonna be mine, or au revoir, cherie
	It's the French Foreign Legion for me

  FRENESI
	Some time ago, I wandered down into Old Mexico
	While I was there, I felt romance everywhere
	Moon was shining bright, and I could hear laughing voices in the night
	Everyone was gay, it was the start of their holiday
It was a fiesta down in Mexico, and so I stopped to see the show
I knew that frenesi meant "Please love me", and I could say frenesi
A lovely senorita caught my eye, I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And, never knowing that it came from me, I gently sighed frenesi
     She stopped, and raised her eyes to mine, her lips were pleading to be kissed
     Her eyes were soft as candle-shine, so how was I to resist?
And now, without a heart to call my own, a greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses were for me, alone, who wouldn't say frenesi?

FRIENDLY PERSUASION
Thee I love, more than the meadow, so green and still
More than the mulberries on the hill
More than the buds on the May apple tree, I love thee
	Arms have I, strong as the oak, for this occasion
	Lips have I, to kiss thee, too, in friendly persuasion
Thee is mine, though I don't know many words of praise
Thee pleasures me in a hundred ways
Put on your bonnet, your cape, and your glove
And come with me, for thee I love

Thee is mine, though I don't know many words of praise
Thee pleasures me in a hundred ways
Put on your bonnet, your cape, and your glove
And come with me, for thee I love

FROM  ME TO YOU
If there's anything that you want, if there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along, with love from me to you
If there's anything that you want, like a heart that's oh so true
Just call on me and I'll send it along, with love from me to you
I've got arms that long to hold you and keep you by my side
I've got lips that long to kiss you and keep you satisfied.....oooooooo  (stop)
If there's anything that you want, if there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along, with love from me to you, to you, to you, to you.

FROM THIS MOMENT ON
From this moment on, you for me dear, only two for tea, dear, from this moment on
From this happy day, no more blue songs, only whoop-dee-doo songs, from this moment on
	For you got the love I need so much, got the skin that I love to touch
	Got the arms to hold me tight, got the sweet lips to kiss me good night
Oh oh, from this moment on, you and I babe, we'll be riding high, babe
Every care is gone, from this moment on

FROSTY THE SNOWMAN
Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal.
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say.
He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day.
	There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found,
	For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around.
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me.
Thumpity-thump-thump, thumpity-thump-thump, look at Frosty go
Thumpity-thump-thump, thumpity-thump-thump, over the fields of snow.

THE FROZEN LOGGER
As I sat down one evening within a small cafe
A forty year old waitress to me these words did say:
	"I see that you are a logger, and not just a common bum
	'Cause nobody but a logger stirs his coffee with his thumb
My lover was a logger, there's none like him today;
If you'd pour whiskey on it he would eat a bale of hay
	He never shaved his whiskers from off of his horny hide;
	He'd just drive them in with a hammer and bite them off inside
My lover came to see me upon one freezing day;
He held me in a fond embrace which broke three vertebrae
	He kissed me when we parted, so hard that he broke my jaw;
	I could not speak to tell him he'd forgot his mackinaw
I saw my logger leaving, sauntering through the snow
Going bravely homeward at forty-eight below
	The weather it tried to freeze him, it tried its level best;
	At a hundred degrees below zero, he buttoned up his vest
It froze clean through to China, it froze to the stars above;
At a thousand degrees below zero, it froze my logger love
	And so I lost my lover, and to this cafe I come
	And here I wait till someone stirs his coffee with his thumb."

FUNNY HOW TIME SLIPS AWAY
Well, hello there, my, it's been a long, long time
How am I doin'? Oh, I guess that I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now, and it seems now, that it was only yesterday
Gee, ain't it funny, how time slips away.

How's your new love? I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard you told him that you'd love him till the end of time
Now, that's the same thing that you told me, and it seems like just the other day
Gee, ain't it funny, how time slips away.

I gotta go now, I guess I'll see you 'round
Don't know when, though, never know when I'll be back in town
But, remember what I tell you, in time you're gonna pay
And it's surprising, how time slips away.

THE GAMBLER
On a warm summer's evenin', on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turn's a-starin' out the window, at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak

He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were, by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey, I'll give you some advice."

So I handed him my bottle, and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette, and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, you gotta learn to play it right."
	You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
	Know when to walk away, and know when to run
	You never count your money, when you're sittin' at the table
	There'll be time enough for countin', when the dealin's done
Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away, and knowin' what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner, and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

And when he finished speakin', he turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette, and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words, I found an ace that I could keep
	You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
	Know when to walk away, and know when to run
	You never count your money, when you're sittin' at the table
	There'll be time enough for countin', when the dealin's done

GAME OF LOVE
The purpose of a man is to love a woman, and the purpose of a woman is to love a man,
So come on baby let's start today, come on baby let's play the game of love, love, la la la la la love

It started long ago in the Garden of Eden, when Adam said to Eve, baby, you're for me
So come on baby let's start today..........
	Love your daddy with all your might
	Put your arms around me, hold me tight, play the game of love

GAMES PEOPLE PLAY  (Joe South)
Oh, the games people play, now, every night and every day, now
Never meaning what they say, now, never saying what they mean
And they while away the hours in their ivory towers
Till they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine
	La da da da da da da da, la da da da da da da dee
	Talkin' 'bout you and me, and the games people play
Oh, we make one another cry, break a heart, then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts, and we hope to die, that the other was to blame
But neither one will ever give in, so we gaze at our eight by ten
Thinkin' 'bout the things that might have been, and it's a dirty rotten shame
	La da da da da da da da, la da da da da da da dee
	Talkin' 'bout you and me, and the games people play
People walkin' up to you, singin' Glory Halleluia
And they're tryin' to sock it to you, in the name of the Lord
They're gonna teach you how to meditate, read your horoscope, cheat your fate
And furthermore, to hell with hate, come on and get on board
	La da da da da da da da, la da da da da da da dee
	Talkin' 'bout you and me, and the games people play
Look around, tell me what you see. What's happenin' to you and me
God grant me the serenity to just remember who I am
'Cause you've given up your sanity for your pride and your vanity
Turn your back on humanity, and you don't give a da da da da da
	La da da da da da da da, la da da da da da da dee
	Talkin' 'bout you and me, and the games people play

GAMES PEOPLE PLAY (Spinners)
Can't get no rest, don't know how I work all day. When will I learn? Memories get in the way
I walk around, I can't hear a sound, folks talkin' loud
But I don't see at all, I gotta get away, gotta get away
I don't know where to go, it's hopeless, so, I guess I'll leave it alone

Well, I spent all that day fixin' up to go somewhere. Thought I was late, and I found she wasn't there
I guess I'll find the love, peace of mind, some other time
But I still have today, I gotta get away, gotta get away
I don't know where to go, it's hopeless, so, I guess I'll leave it alone
	Games people play, night or day, they're just not matchin'
	What they should do, keeps me feelin' blue
	Been down too long, right, wrong, I just can't stop it
	Spending all day, thinking just of you
12:45, headed for the subway home, I took my time, 'cause I felt so all alone
Not far away, I heard a funny sound, took a look around
And I could see her face, smilin' as she came, callin' out my name
So I know where to go, we'll take it slow, I guess I'll call it a day
	Games people play, night or day, they're just not matching
	What they should do, keeps me feelin' blue
	Been down too long, right, wrong, I just can't stop it
	Spendin' all day, thinkin' just of you


GARBAGE TRUCK SONG
	Garbage trucks, garbage trucks,
	Drivin' through the town, pickin' cans up off the ground, garbage trucks
Sometimes when I wake up early in the morning, I hear a monster sound
I look out the window, and there's a garbage truck, pickin' cans up off the ground
It empties the can, and puts it back down, and drives away so loud.
	Garbage trucks, garbage trucks,
	Drivin' through the town, pickin' cans up off the ground, garbage trucks
The garbage man drives up in the garbage truck, and picks that garbage up
He dumps it in the back, so that it can be crushed, and drives off to the dump
He backs up to a pile of all the trash from the town, and dumps the whole thing out
	Garbage trucks, garbage trucks,
	Drivin' through the town, pickin' cans up off the ground, garbage trucks
They come in many colors, some are blue, and some are brown, and some are green
And, wouldn't you know it, there are some that can pick up recycling
	Garbage trucks, garbage trucks,
	Drivin' through the town, pickin' cans up off the ground, garbage trucks

GARDEN PARTY
I went to a garden party, to remi-nisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories and play our songs again
When I got to the garden party, they all knew my name
But no one recognized me, I didn't look the same
	But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
	You see you can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself
People came from miles around, everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air
And over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes, wearing his disguise

I played them all the old songs, I thought that's why they came
No one heard the music, we didn't look the same
I said hello to Mary Lou, she belongs to me
When I sang a song about a honky-tonk, it was time to leave
	Chorus, la da da da
Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Goode
Playing guitar like a ring an' a bell, and lookin' like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties, I wish you a lot a' luck
But if memories were all I sang, I'd rather drive a truck
	Chorus la da da da


THE GARDEN SONG
  Chorus:
	Inch by inch, row by row, gonna make this garden grow
	All it takes is a rake and a hoe and a piece of fertile ground
	Inch by inch, row by row Someone bless these seeds I sow
	Someone warm them from below 'til the rain comes tumbling down
Pullin' weeds and pickin' stones, we are made of dreams and bones
I feel the need to grow my own cause the time is close at hand
Grain for grain, sun and rain I'll find my way in nature's chain
Tune my body and my brain to the music of the land
	Chorus
Plant your rows straight and long,
Temper them with prayer and song
Mother earth will keep you strong if you give her love and care
An old crow watching hungrily from his perch in yonder tree
In my garden I'm as free as that feathered thief up there
	Chorus

GENTLE ON MY MIND
It's knowin' that your door is always open and your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by for-gotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried up on some line
That keeps you in the backroads by the rivers of my memory, that keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy, planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that some-body said, be-cause they thought we fit together walkin'.
It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursing or for-giving,
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the backroads by the rivers of my memory,
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines and the junkyards and the highways come be-tween us,
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother, 'cause she turned and I was gone.
I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face,
And the summer sun might burn me 'till I'm blind,
But not to where I cannot see you, walkin' on the backroads, by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from the gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some trainyard;
My beard, a roughenin' coal pile, and a dirty hat pulled low across my face.
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can I pre-tend I hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the backroads by the rivers of my memory,
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind, (repeat last 2 lines and add):  ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind.

GEORGIA ON MY MIND
Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind

I say Georgia, Georgia, a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear, as moonlight through the pines
	Other arms reach out to me, other eyes smile tenderly
	Still, in peaceful dreams I see the road leads back to you
Whoa, Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
I said, just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind

GEORGY GIRL
Hey there, Georgy girl, swingin' down the street so fancy-free
Nobody you meet could ever see the loneliness there.......inside you
Hey there, Georgy girl, why do all the boys just pass you by?
Could it be you just don't try or is it the clothes you wear?
	     You're always window shopping but never stopping to buy
	     So shed those dowdy feathers and fly - a little bit
Hey there, Georgy girl, there's another Georgy deep in-side
Bring out all the love you hide and, oh, what a change there'd be
The world would see a new Georgy girl

Hey there, Georgy girl, dreamin' of the someone you could be
Life is a reality, you can't always run away
	     Don't be so scared of changing and rearranging your-self
	     It's time for jumping down from the shelf - a little bit
Hey there, Georgy girl, there's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide and, oh, what a change there'd be
The world would see a new Georgy girl

GET A JOB
Sha na na na, sha na na na na, sha na na na, sha na na na na,
	Sha na na na, sha na na na na, sha na na na, sha na na na na,
	Yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip, mum mum mum mum mum mum
	Get a job! Sha na na na, sha na na na na
Every morning about this time, she gets me out of my bed, and cryin', "Get a job!"
Sha na na na, sha na na na na,
And after breakfast, everyday, she throws the want ads right my way
And never fails to say, "get a job!"
	Sha na na na, sha na na na na, sha na na na, sha na na na na,
	Sha na na na, sha na na na na, sha na na na, sha na na na na,
	Yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip, mum mum mum mum mum mum
	Get a job! Sha na na na, sha na na na na
And when I get the paper, I read it through and through
And my girl never fails to say if there is any work for me,
And then I go back to the house, I hear the woman's mouth
Preachin' and a cryin', tellin' me that I'm lying 'bout a job that I never could find.

GET HAPPY
Forget your troubles, come on, get happy, you better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah, come on, get happy, get ready for the Judgment Day

The sun is shinin', come on, get happy, the Lord is waitin' to take your hand
Shout Hallelujah, come on, get happy, we're goin' to the promised land
	We're headin' 'cross the river, wash your sins away in the tide
	And it's all so peaceful on the other side
Forget your troubles......

GET ME TO THE CHURCH ON TIME
I'm getting married in the morning, ding-dong the bells are gonna chime
Pull out the stopper, let's have a whopper, but get me to the church on time.

I got to be there in the morning, spruced up and lookin' in me prime
Girls, come and kiss me, show how you'll miss me, but get me to the church on time.
	If I am dancing, roll up the floor, if I am whistling, wheel me out the door
I'm getting married in the morning, ding-dong the bells are gonna chime

For Pete's sake get me to the church on time, on time, on time!

GET READY
I never met a girl who makes me feel the way that you do. (You're alright)
Whenever I'm asked who makes my dreams real, I say that you do. (You're outta sight)
So, fee-fi-fo-fum, look out, baby, 'cause here I come.
	And I'm bringin' you a love that's true, so get ready, so get ready.
	I'm gonna try to make you love me too, so get ready, so get ready, 'cause here I come.
	(Get ready 'cause here I come)  I'm on my way. (Get ready 'cause here I come)
If you wanna play hide and seek with love, let me remind you (It's alright)
But the lovin' you're gonna miss and the time it takes to find you (It's outta sight)
So, tweedly-dee, tweedly-dum, look out baby, 'cause here I come.

	I'm gonna try to make you love me too, so get ready, so get ready, 'cause here I come.

GETTING TO KNOW YOU
Getting to know you, getting to know all about you
Getting to like you, getting to hope you like me
Getting to know you, putting it my way but nicely, you are precisely my cup of tea.
Getting to know you, getting to feel free and easy
When I am with you, getting to know what to say
Haven't you noticed? Suddenly I'm bright and breezy
Because of all the beautiful and you, things I'm learning about you, day by day.

GET TOGETHER
Love is but a song we sing, fear's the way we die.
You can make the mountains ring, or make the angels cry.
Though the bird is on the wing, and you may not know why.
	C'mon people now, smile on your brother, everybody get together,
	Try to love one another right now.
Some may come and some may go, we will surely pass.
When the one that left us here, returns for us at last.
We are but a moment's sunlight, fading in the grass.
	C'mon people......
If you hear the song I sing, you will understand.
You hold the key to love and fear, all in your trembling hand.
Just one key unlocks them both, it's there at your com-mand..
	C'mon people......
	Try to love one another right now, right now, right now, right now!

(GHOST) RIDERS IN THE SKY
An old cowpoke went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A-plowin' through the ragged skies, and up a cloudy draw
	Yippie-yi yaaay, yippie-yi ooohh, a ghost herd in the sky
Their brands were still on fire, and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny, and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard, and he heard their mournful cry
	Yippie-yi yaaay, yippie-yi ooohh, ghost riders in the sky
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd, but they ain't caught 'em yet
 'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cries
	Yippie-yi yaaay, yippie-yi ooohh, ghost riders in the sky
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
'If you wanna save your soul from hell, a-ridin' on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride,
Trying to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies
	Yippie-yi ooohh, yippie-yi yaaay, ghost riders in the sky
	Ghost riders in the sky, ghost riders in the sky

GIMME A LITTLE KISS
Gimme a little kiss, will you, huh? Whadda ya gonna miss, will you, huh?
Gosh oh gee, why do you refuse?  I can't see what you're gonna lose.
Gimme a little squeeze, will you, huh? Why do you wanna make me blue?
I wouldn't say a word if I were asking for the world,
But what's a little kiss between a fella and his girl?
Gimme a little kiss, will you, huh, and I'll give it right back to you.

Gimme a little kiss, will you, huh? Must I go on like this, will you, huh
Once again, a plea I'm gonna make, tell me when do I get a break
Say that you're givin' in, will you huh, anything that you ask I'll do
I'll take you for a little ride, where we can be alone,
And once you kiss me, you will never think of walking home
Give me a little kiss, will you, huh, or I'll steal about ten from you.

GIMME LITTLE SIGN
If you do want me, gimme little sugar, if you don't want me, don't lead me on, girl
But, if you need me, show me that you love me
And when I'm feeling blue, and I want you, there's just one thing that you should do
	Just gimme some kind of sign, girl, oh, my baby
	To show me that you're mine, girl, oh, yeah
	Just gimme some kind of sign, girl, oh, my darling
	To show me that you're mine, girl, alright
If you do want me, gimme little sweet talk, if you don't want me, don't lead me on, girl
But if you need me, show me that you love me
And, when I'm feeling down, wearing a frown, you'll be there when I look around
	Just gimme some kind of sign, girl, oh, my baby
	To show me that you're mine, girl, alright
	Just gimme some kind of sign, girl, oh, my baby
	To show me that you're mine, girl, alright

	To show me that you're mine, girl, oh, yeah
	Just gimme some kind of sign, girl, oh, my darling
	To show me that you're mine, girl, alright

GIRL
Is there anybody going to listen to my story, all about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry, still, you don't regret a single day
	Ah, girl, girl, girl, ah, girl, girl, girl,
When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her, she will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her, after all this time I don't know why
	Ah, girl, girl, girl, ah, girl, girl, girl,
She's the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there, you feel a fool
When you say she's looking good, she acts as if it's understood:
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh
	Ah, girl, girl, girl, ah, girl, girl, girl,
Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
	Ah, girl, girl, girl, ah, girl, girl, girl

GIRL FROM IPANEMA
Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes each one she passes goes ah...
When she walks she's like a samba that swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes each one she passes goes ah...
	Oh, but I watch her so sadly. How can I tell her I love her
	Yes I would give my heart gladly
	But each day when she walks to the sea, she looks straight ahead not at me
Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes I smile but she doesn't see, she just doesn't see, no she doesn't see

GIRL TALK
They (we)  like to chat about the dresses they (we) will wear tonight
They (we)  chew the fat about their (our) tresses and the neighbors' fight
Inconsequential things that men don't really care to know
Become essential things that women find so "apropos"
But that's a dame, they're (we're) all the same, it's just a game, they (we) call it girl talk, girl talk

They (we) all meow about the ups and downs of all their (our) friends
The "who," the "how," the "why," they (we) dish the dirt, it never ends
The weaker sex, the speaker sex, we (you) mortal males behold,
But though we joke, we wouldn't trade you for a ton of gold
So, baby, stay, and gab away, but hear me say that, after girl talk, talk to me.
(It's all been planned, so take my hand, please understand the sweetest girl talk talks of you

THE GIRL THAT I MARRY
The girl that I marry will have to be as soft and as pink as a nursery
The girl I call my own will wear satins and laces, and smell of cologne

Her nails will be polished, and, in her hair, she'll wear a gardenia, and I'll be there
'Stead of flittin', I'll be sittin' next to her, and she'll  purr like a kitten
	A doll I can carry, the girl that I marry must be

Her nails will be polished, and, in her hair, she'll wear a gardenia, and I'll be there
'Stead of flittin', I'll be sittin' next to her, and she'll  purr like a kitten
	A doll I can carry, the girl that I marry must be

GIVE A LITTLE BIT
Give a little bit, give a little bit of your love to me
I'll give a little bit, I'll give a little bit of my love to you
	There's so much that we need to share, so send a smile and show you care
I'll give a little bit, I'll give a little bit of my life for you
So give a little bit, oh, give a little bit of your time to me
	See the man with the lonely eyes, oh, take his hand, you'll be surprised
Give a little bit, give a little bit of your love to me
I'll give a little bit, I'll give a little bit of my life for you
	Now's the time that we need to care, so, find yourself, we're on our way back home

Going home, don't you need, don't you need to feel at home?
Oh, yeah, we gotta see, you gotta get a feeling
You come along too, you can come along too, yeah, you can come along too, yeah.

GIVE ME THE SIMPLE LIFE
	Folks are blessed, who make the best of everyday, living by their own philosophy
	Everyone beneath the sun must find a way, and I have found the only way for me
I don't believe in frettin' and grievin', why mess around with strife
I never was cut out to step out, and strut out, give me the simple life
Some find it pleasant, dining on pheasant, those things roll off my knife
Just serve me tomatoes, and mashed potatoes, give me the simple life
	A cottage small is all I'm after, not one that's spacious and wide
	A house that rings with joy and laughter, and the ones you love inside
Some like the high road, I like the low road, free from the cares and strife
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed-y, give me the simple life
     I greet the dawn when I awaken, the sky is clear up above
     I like my scrambled eggs and bacon, served by someone that I love
Life could be thrilling with one who's willing to be a farmer's wife
Just calling me pappy would make me so happy, give me the simple life

GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROADWAY
Did you ever see two Yankees part upon a foreign shore
When the good ship's just about to start for Old New York once more
With tear-dimmed eye they say goodbye, they're friends without a doubt.
When the man on the pier shouts, "Let them clear", as the ship strikes out.....
Give my regards to Broadway,  remember me to Herald Square
Tell all the gang at Forty Second Street that I will soon be there
Whisper of how I'm yearning to mingle with the old time throng
Give my regards to old Broadway and say that I'll be there 'ere long.

GLAD ALL OVER
You say  that you  love me (say  you   love me), all of the time (all of the time)
You say that  you  need me (say you need me),  you'll   always be mine (always be mine)
	I'm feelin' glad all over, yes, I'm glad all over, baby, I'm glad all over, so glad you're mine
I'll make you happy (make you happy), you'll never  be blue (never be blue)
You'll have no sorrow   (have no sorrow), 'cause I'll always be true  (always be true)
	I'm feelin' glad all over, yes, I'm glad all over, baby, I'm glad all over, so glad you're mine
	           Other girls may try to take me away (take me away)
	           But you know, it's by your side I will stay,  I will stay
Our love will last now (our love will last),  till the end of time (end of time)
Because this love now (because this love),  is gonna be yours and mine (yours and mine)
	And I'm feelin'  glad all over, yes, I'm glad all over, baby, I'm glad all over, so glad you're mine
	          Other girls may try to take me away (take me away)
	          But you know, it's by your side I will stay I will stay
Our love will last now (our love will last),  till the end of time (end of time)
Because this love now (because this love),  is gonna be yours and mine (yours and mine)
	And I'm feelin' glad all over, yes, I'm glad all over, baby, I'm    glad all over, so glad you're mine
	I'm so glad you're mine now, I'm so glad that you're mine now
	I'm so glad that you're mine now, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa . . . .

THE GLORY OF LOVE
You've got to give a little, take a little, and let your poor heart break a little
That's the story of, that's the glory of love
You've got to laugh a little, cry a little, before the clouds roll by a little
That's the story of, that's the glory of love
	As long as there's the two of us, we've got the world and all its charms
	And when the world is through with us we've got each other's arms
You've got to win a little, lose a little, and always have the blues a little
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.

THE GLOW-WORM
Shine little glow-worm, glimmer, glimmer, shine little glow-worm, glimmer, glimmer
Lead us, lest too far we wander, love's sweet voice is calling yonder
Shine little glow-worm, glimmer, glimmer, hey there, don't get dimmer, dimmer
Light the path below, above,  and lead us on to love
	Glow little glow-worm, fly of fire, glow like an incandescent wire
	Glow for the female of the species,  turn on the AC and the DC
	This night could use a little brightnin', light up, you little ol' bug of lightnin'
	When you gotta glow, you gotta glow, glow little glow-worm, glow
Glow little glow-worm, glow and glimmer, swim through the sea of night, little swimmer
Thou aeronautical boll weevil, illuminate yon woods primeval
See how the shadows deep and darken, you and your chick should get to sparkin'
I got a gal that I love so, glow little glow-worm, glow
	Glow little glow-worm, turn the key on, you are equipped with taillight neon
	You got a cute vest-pocket Mazda, which you can make both slow and faster
	I don't know who you took the shine to, or who you're out to make a sign to
	I got a gal that I love so, glow, little glow-worm, glow
	Glow little glow-worm, glow, glow....little....glow-worm....glow

GO AWAY, LITTLE GIRL
Go away, little girl, go away, little girl, I'm not supposed to be a-lone with you
I know that your lips are sweet,  but our lips must never meet
I belong to someone else, and I must be true
Go away, little girl, go away, little girl, it's hurting me more each minute that you de-lay
When you are near me like this, you're much too hard to resist
So, go away, little girl, before I beg you to stay

GOD BLESS AMERICA
God Bless America, land that I Love.
Stand beside her and guide her through the night with the light from above
From the mountains to the prairies, to the ocean, white with foam.
God bless America, my home sweet home,
God bless America, my home sweet home.

GOD BLESS THE CHILD
Them that's got shall get, them that's not shall lose. So the bible says, and it still is news
Mama may have, Papa may have, but God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own.
Yes the strong shall get more while the weak ones fade, empty pockets don't ever make the grade
Mama may have, Papa may have, but God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own.
	Money, you got lots of friends crowdin' 'round your door,
	When your gone and spendin' ends, they don't come no more.
Rich relations give a crust of bread and such, you can help yourself, but don't take too much.
Mama may have, Papa may have, but God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own.

GOING OUT OF MY HEAD
Well, I think I'm goin' out of my head.
Yes, I think I'm goin' out of my head, over you, over you
I want you to want me, I need you so badly, I can't think of anything but you
And I think I'm goin' out of my head
'Cause I can't explain the tears that I've shed over you, over you
I see you each morning, but you just walk past me, you don't even know that I exist
Goin' out of my head over you, out of my head over you
Out of my head day and night, night and day and night, wrong or right
	I must think of a way into your heart
	There's no reason why my being shy should keep us apart
And I think I'm goin' out of my head. Yes, I think I'm goin' out of my head
Goin' out of my head over you, out of my head over you
Out of my head day and night, night and day and night, wrong or right
Night and day and night. And I think I'm going out of my head.

GOING TO THE ZOO
Daddy's taking us to the zoo tomorrow, zoo tomorrow, zoo tomorrow;
Daddy's taking us to the zoo tomorrow, we can stay all day.
	We're going to the zoo, zoo, zoo, how about you, you, you?
	You can come too, too, too, we're going to the zoo, zoo, zoo.
See the elephant with the long trunk swingin', great big ears and long trunk swingin',
Snuffin' up peanuts with the long trunk swinging, we can stay all day.
	Chorus
See all the monkeys scritch scritch scratchin', jumpin' all around and scritch scritch scratchin',
Hangin' by their long tails scritch scritch scratchin', we can stay all day.
	Chorus
Big black bear, all a huff huff a-puffin';
Coat's too heavy, he's huff huff a-puffin',
Don't get too near the huff huff a-puffin',
Or you won't stay all day.
	Chorus
Seals in the pool all honk honk honkin', catchin' fish and honk honk honkin',
Little seals honk honk honkin', we can stay all day.
	Chorus
We stayed all day and we're gettin' sleepy, sittin' in the car gettin' sleep sleep sleepy,
Home already, and we're sleep sleep sleepy, we have stayed all day.
	We've been to the zoo, zoo, zoo, so have you, you, you.
	You came too, too, too, we've been to the zoo, zoo, zoo.
Momma's taking us to the zoo tomorrow, zoo tomorrow, zoo tomorrow;
Momma's taking us to the zoo tomorrow, we can stay all day.
	We're going to the zoo, zoo, zoo, how about you, you, you?
	You can come too, too, too, we're going to the zoo, zoo, zoo.

GONE WITH THE WIND
Gone with the wind, just like a leaf that has blown away
Gone with the wind, my romance has flown away
	Yesterday's kisses are still on my lips, I had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips
But now all is gone, gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart
Gone with the wind, the gladness that filled my heart
Just like a flame, love burned brightly, then became
An empty smoke dream that has gone, gone with the wind

GONNA BUILD A MOUNTAIN
Gonna build a mountain, from a little hill. I'm gonna build a mountain, least I hope I will.
Gonna build a mountain, I'm gonna build it high.
I don't know how I'm gonna do it, only know I'm gonna try.
	Gonna build a daydream, from a little hope.
	Gonna push that daydream, up the mountain slope.
	I'm gonna build a daydream, I'm gonna see it through.
	Gonna build a mountain and a daydream,
	Gonna make 'em both come true.
Gonna build a heaven, from a little hell. gonna build a heaven, and I know darn well
If I build my mountain with a lot of care,
I'll push my daydream up the mountain, heaven will be waitin' there
	When I build my heaven, as I will someday,
	And the Lord sends Gabriel to take me away.
	Want a fine young son, to take my place.
	I'll leave a son in my heaven on earth with the good Lord's grace.

GONNA GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU NOW
	Mm   mm, mm mm, gonna get along with-out you now
	Mm   mm, my honey, mm mm, my honey, gonna get along with-out you now
You told me I was the neatest thing, you even asked me to wear your ring
Then you ran around with every guy in town, you never cared if it got me down
	Mm   mm, mm mm, gonna get along with-out you now
	Mm   mm, my honey, mm mm, my honey, gonna get along with-out you now
Got a-long without you be-fore I met you, gonna get along with-out you now
Gonna find somebody who's twice as cute, 'cause I didn't like you any-how
You told everybody that we were friends, but this is where our friendship ends
'Cause all of a sudden you changed your tune, you haven't been around since way last June
	Mm   mm, mm mm, gonna get along with-out you now
Mm   mm, my honey, mm mm, my honey, gonna get along with-out you now
So long, my honey, good-bye, my dear, gonna get along without you now

GOODBYE, CRUEL WORLD
(Oh), Goodbye, cruel world, I'm off to join the circus. Gonna be a broken-hearted clown.
Paint my face with a good-for-nothin' smile,
'Cause a mean, fickle woman, turned my whole world upside down.  (Goodbye, cruel world)
Fare-well to love, I'm off to join the circus, gotta find a way to hide my tears.
Bet I'll have them rollin' in the aisle,
And I'll for-get that woman, if it takes a hundred years.   (Goodbye, cruel world)
	 Oh, oh, oh, step right up and take a look at a fool.  He's got a heart as stubborn as a mule.
	C'mon everybody, he's good for a laugh, and no one could tell his heart is broken in half.
Well, the joke's on me, I'm off to join the circus. Oh, Mr. Barnum, save a place for me.
Shoot me out of a cannon, I don't care,  let the people point at me and stare.
I'll tell the world that woman, wher-ever she may be,
That mean, fickle woman made a cryin' clown outta me.    (Goodbye cruel world)
Shoot me out of a cannon, I don't care,   let the people point at me and stare.
I'll tell the world that woman, wherever she may be,
That mean, fickle woman made a cryin' clown outta me.    (Goodbye cruel world)

GOODBYE GIRL
All your life you've waited for love to come and stay
And now that I have found you, you must not slip away
I know it's hard believin'  the words you've heard before
But, darlin', you must trust them just once more, 'cause baby
	Goodbye doesn't mean forever
	Let me tell you goodbye doesn't mean we'll never be together again
	If you wake up and I'm not there, I won't be long away
	'Cause the things you do, my Goodbye Girl, will bring me back to you
I know you've been taken, afraid to hurt again
You fight the love you feel for me, instead of giving in
But I can wait forever, helping you to see
That I was meant for you and you for me, so remember
	Goodbye doesn't mean forever
	Let me tell you goodbye doesn't mean we'll never be together again
	Though we may be so far apart, you still will have my heart
	So forget your past, my Goodbye Girl, 'cause now you're home at last

GOODBYE TO LOVE
I'll say goodbye to love, no one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by
And all I know of love is how to live without it, I just can't seem to find it.
	So I've made my mind up I must live my life alone
	And though it's not the easy way, I guess I've always known
I'd say goodbye to love, there are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose these bitter memories
And I'll find that there is someone to believe in, and to live for something I could live for.
	All the years of useless search have finally reached an end
	Loneliness and empty days will be my only friend
	From this day love is forgotten, I'll go on as best I can.

	What lies in the future is a mystery to us all
	No one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that I've been wrong
But for now this is my song. And, it's goodbye to love. I'll say goodbye to love.

GOOD DAY SUNSHINE
	Good day sunshine. Good day sunshine. Good day sunshine.
I need to laugh, and when the sun is out, I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way, I'm in love and it's a sunny day.
	Good day sunshine. Good day sunshine. Good day sunshine.
We take a walk, the sun is shining down, burns my feet as they touch the ground..
	Good day sunshine. Good day sunshine. Good day sunshine.
Then we lie beneath a shady tree, I love her and she's loving me.
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine. I'm so proud to know that she is mine.
	Good day sunshine. Good day sunshine. Good day sunshine. Good day sunshine.
	Good day sunshine. Good day sunshine. Good day sunshine. Good day sunshine.

THE GOOD LIFE
Oh, the good life, full of fun seems to be the ideal
Mm, the good life lets you hide all the sadness you feel
You won't really fall in love, for you can't take the chance
So, please be honest with yourself, don't try to fake romance

It's the good life, to be free and explore the unknown
Like the heartaches, when you learn you must face them alone
Please remember, I still want you, and, in case you wonder why
Well, just wake up, kiss the good life goodbye.

On s'amuse à passer avec tous ses copains
Des nuits blanches qui se penchant sur les petits matins

GOOD MORNING
Good mornin', good mornin', we've talked the whole night through. Good mornin', good mornin' to you
Good mornin', good mornin', it's great to stay out late. Good mornin', good mornin' to you
	When the band began to play, the stars were shining bright
	Now the milkman's on his way, it's too late to say, "Good night."
So, good mornin', good mornin',   sunbeams will soon smile through
Good mornin', good mornin' to you and you and you and you

Good mornin, good mornin', we've gabbed the whole night through. Good mornin', good mornin' to you

In the mornin', good mornin', it's great to stay up late. Good mornin', good mornin' to you
   (Might just be as zippy if we was in Mississippi)
When we left the movie show, the future wasn't bright
But, came the dawn, the show goes on, and I don't want to say good night!
So say good mornin', good mornin', rainbows are shining through
Good mornin', good mornin', bon-jour, mon-sieur, buenos dias,  muchas frias
Buon giorno, guten Morgen, good morning, good morning to you! Good morning, friends!

GOODNIGHT, IRENE
	Irene, goodnight, Irene, goodnight.
	Goodnight, Irene, goodnight, Irene, I'll see you in my dreams
Last Saturday night I got married, me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife are parted, I'm gonna take another stroll downtown
	Chorus
Sometimes I live in the country, sometimes I live in the town
Sometimes I have a great notion to jump in the river and drown
	Chorus
Stop your ramblin', stop your gamblin', stop staying out late at night
Go home to your wife and family, sit down by the fireside bright
	Chorus

GOODNIGHT, MY LOVE
	    Ooo-wah-oh, wah-ooo, wah-ooo, wah-ooo, wah-ooo, wow.
	    Ooo-wah-oh, wah-ooo, wah-ooo, wah-ooo, wah-ooo, wow.
Goodnight, my love, pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love.
May  tomorrow be sunny and bright, and bring you closer to me.
	Wah-oh, wah-ooo, wah-ooo, wah-ooo, wah-ooo, wow.
Before you go, there's just one thing I'd like to know.
Is your love still warm for me, or has it grown cold?
	If you should awake in the still of night, please have no fears.
	For I'll be there, you know I care, please give your love to  me,  dear, only.
Goodnight, my love, pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love.
May  tomorrow be sunny and bright, and bring you closer to me.
	If you should awake in the still of night, please have no fears.
	For I'll be there, you know I care, please give your love to  me,  dear, only.
Goodnight, my love  pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love.
May  tomorrow be sunny and bright, and bring you closer to me.

GOODNIGHT, MY SOMEONE
Goodnight, my someone, goodnight, my love
Sleep tight, my someone, sleep tight, my love
Our star is shining its brightest light, for goodnight, my someone, goodnight
Sweet dreams be yours, dear, if dreams there be
Sweet dreams to carry you close to me
I wish they may and I wish they might, now goodnight, my someone, goodnight.
	True love can be whispered from heart to heart, when lovers are parted, they say
	But I must depend on a wish and a star, as long as my heart doesn't know who you are
Sweet dreams be yours, dear, if dreams there be
Sweet dreams to carry you close to me
I wish they may and I wish they might, now goodnight, my someone, goodnight.

GOODNIGHT, SWEETHEART
Goodnight Sweet-heart, all my prayers are for you
Goodnight Sweet-heart,   I'll be watching o'er you
Tears and parting may make us forlorn
But with the dawn a new day is born, so I'll say
Goodnight, sweet-heart, sleep  will banish sorrow
Goodnight, sweet-heart,  when we meet to morrow,
Dreams enfold you,  in them, dear I'll hold you,
Good-night, sweet-heart,  good-night.

GOODTIME CHARLIE'S GOT THE BLUES
Everybody's gone away, said they're movin' to L.A
There's not a soul I know around, everybody's leavin' town

Some caught a freight, some caught a plane, find the sunshine, leave the rain
They said this town will waste your time, guess they're right-it's wastin' mine
	Some gotta win, and some gotta lose,
	Good Time Charlie's got the blues, Good Time Charlie's got the blues
You know my heart keeps tellin me, "You're not a kid at thirty-three
You play around, you lose your wife, you play too long, you lose your life

Got my pills to ease the pain, can't find a thing to stop the rain
I'd love to try and settle down, but everybody's leavin' town
	Some gotta win, and some gotta lose,
	Good Time Charlie's got the blues, Good Time Charlie's got the blues

GOODY GOODY
So you met someone who set you back on your heels, goody, goody!
So you met someone and now you know how it feels, goody, goody!
So you gave him your heart, too, just as I gave mine to you.
And you broke it in little pieces, now how do you  do?
So you lie awake just singin' the blues all night, goody, goody!
So you think that love's a barrel of dynamite.
Hooray and halle-lu-jah!  You had it comin' to ya.
Goody, goody for him.        Goody, goody for me.
And I hope you're satis-fied, you ras -cal  you.
And I hope you're satis-fied, you ras -cal  you.

GOT MY MIND SET ON YOU
	I got my mind set on you, I got my mind set on you,
	I got my mind set on you, I got my mind set on you
But it's gonna take money, a whole lotta spending money
It's gonna take plenty of money to do it right, child
It's gonna take time, a whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, ummm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it right, child
	I got my mind set on you, I got my mind set on you,
	I got my mind set on you, I got my mind set on you
And this time I know it's for real, the feelings that I feel
I know if I put my mind to it, I know that I really could do it
	I got my mind set on you, set on you,
	I got my mind set on you, set on you
But it's gonna take money, a whole lotta spending money
It's gonna take plenty of money to do it right, child
It's gonna take time, a whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, ummm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it right
	I got my mind set on you, I got my mind set on you,
	I got my mind set on you, I got my mind set on you

GOTTA GET UP
	Gotta get up, gotta get out, gotta get home before the morning comes.
	What if I'm late, gotta big date, gotta get home before the sun comes up
	Up and away, got a big day, sorry can't stay, I gotta run run yeah
	Gotta get home, pick up the phone, I gotta let the people know I'm gonna be late
There was a time when we could dance until a quarter to ten,
We never thought it would end then, we never thought it would end,
We used to carry on and drink and do the rock and roll,
We never thought we'd get older, we never thought it'd grow cold, but now
	CHORUS
Down by the sea she knew a sailor who had been to war,
She never even knew a sailor before, she never even knew his name
He'd come to town and he would pound her for a couple of days,
And then he'd sail across the bubbly waves and those were happier days, But now
	CHORUS

GOTTA TRAVEL ON
    I've laid around and played around, this old town too long
    Summer's almost gone, and winter's comin' on
    Well, I've laid around and played around, this old town too long, and I feel like I gotta travel on
Papa writes to Johnny, but Johnny can't come home
Johnny can't come home, no, Johnny can't come home
Papa writes to Johnny, but Johnny can't come home, 'cause he's been on the chain gang too long
  CHORUS
High sheriff and police riding after me, riding after me, yes, coming after me
High sheriff and police coming after me, and I feel like I gotta travel on
  CHORUS
Want to see my honey, want to see her bad, want to see her bad, oh, want to see her bad
Want to see my honey, want to see her bad, she's the best gal this poor boy ever had
  CHORUS

GRANDFATHER'S CLOCK
My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf, so it stood ninety years on the floor
It was  taller by half than the old man himself, though it weighed not a penny-weight more
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born, and was always his treasure and pride
	But it stopped short, never to go again when the old man died
	Ninety years without slumbering, tick, tock, tick, tock
	His life's seconds numbering, tick, tock, tick, tock
	It stopped short, never to go again when the old man died
In watching its pendulum swing to and fro, many hours had he spent while a boy
And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know, and to share both his grief and his joy
For it struck twenty-four when he entered at  the door, with a blooming and beautiful bride
	Chorus
My grandfather said that of those he could hire, not a servant so faithful he found
For it  wasted no time, and had but one desire, at the close of each week to be wound
And it kept in its  place, not a frown upon its face,  and its hands never hung by its side
	Chorus
It  rang an alarm in the dead of the night, an alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming its  flight, that his hour of  departure had come
Still the clock kept the time, with a soft and muffled chime, as we silently stood by his side
	Chorus

GRANDMA'S FEATHER BED
When I was a little bitty boy, just up off a floor,
We used to go down to Grandma's house every month end or so.
We'd have chicken pie and country ham, homemade butter on the bread.
But the best darn thing about Grandma's house was her great big feather bed.
	It was nine feet high and six feet wide, soft as a downy chick
	It was made from the feathers of forty-eleven geese,
	Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick.
	It'd hold eight kids and four hound dogs and a piggy we stole from the shed.
	We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun on Grandma's feather bed.
After supper we'd sit around the fire, the old folks would spit and chew.
Pa would talk about the farm and the war, and Granny'd sing a ballad or two.
I'd sit and listen and watch the fire, till the cobwebs filled my head,
Next thing I'd know I'd wake up in the morning in the middle of the old feather bed.
     REFRAIN
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun on Grandma's feather bed.
Well I love my Ma, I love my Pa, I love Granny and Grandpa too.
I been fishing with my uncle, I ras'led with my cousin, I even kissed Aunt Lou, ew!
But if I ever had to make a choice, I guess it oughta be said
That I'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road for Grandma's feather bed.
I'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road...
I'll have to reconsider 'bout the gal down the road-it get's mighty lonely around here sometimes)
	It was nine feet high and six feet wide, soft as a downy chick
	It was made from the feathers of forty-eleven geese,
	Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick.
	It'd hold eight kids and four hound dogs and a piggy we stole from the shed.
	We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun on Grandma's feather bed.
	We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun on Grandma's feather bed.

GREAT PRETENDER
Oh, yes I'm the great pretender, pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such I pretend too much, I'm lonely but no one can tell
Oh, yes I'm the great pretender, adrift in a world of my own
I've played the game but to my real shame, you've left me to grieve all a-lone
	Too real is this feeling of make-believ
	Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal
Yes, I'm the great pretender, just laughing and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see,  I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still a-round

GREENBACK DOLLAR
Some people say I'm a no count, others say I'm no good
But I'm just a natural-born travelin' man, doin' what I think I should, oh yeah
Doin' what I think I should
	And I don't give a damn about a greenback dollar, spend it as fast as I can
	For a wailin' song, and a good guitar the only things that I understand, oh yeah,
	The only things that I understand
When I was a little baby, my mama, she said, "Son,
Travel where you will, and grow to be a man, and sing what must be sung, poor boy,
Sing what must be sung."
	And I don't give a damn about a greenback dollar, spend it as fast as I can
	For a wailin' song, and a good guitar the only things that I understand, poor boy,
	The only things that I understand
Now that I'm a grown man, I've traveled here and there
And I've learned that a bottle of brandy, and a song, are the only ones who care, oh Lord,
The only ones who care
	And I don't give a damn about a greenback dollar, spend it as fast as I can
	For a wailin' song, and a good guitar the only things that I understand, oh yeah,
	The only things that I understand

GREEN DOLPHIN STREET
Lover, one lovely day, love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for life beyond forgetting.
And through these moments apart
Memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street.

THE GREEN DOOR
Midnight one more night without sleepin', watching till the morning comes peepin'
Green door, what's the secret you're keepin'
There's an old piano and they play it hot behind the green door
Don't know what they're doin' but they laugh a lot behind the green door.
Wish they'd let me in so I could find out what's behind the green door.

Knocked once, tried to tell 'em I'd been there, door slammed, hospitality's thin there
Wonder just what's goin' on in there.
Saw an eyeball peepin' thru a smoky cloud behind the green door
When I said Joe sent me someone laughed out loud behind the green door.
All I want to do do is join the happy crew behind the green door.

GREEN, GREEN GRASS OF HOME
The old home town looks the same, as I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
     Down the road I look, and there runs Mary, hair of gold and lips like cherries.
     It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.
	Yes,they'll all come to meet me arms areaching, smiling sweetly
	It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.
The old house is still standing, though the paint is cracked and dry,
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
     Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary, hair of gold and lips like cherries.
     It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.
Then I awake and look around me at the four gray walls that surround me
And I realize, yes, that I was only dreaming.
     For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre, arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak
     Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home
	Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree;
	As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home.

GREEN LEAVES OF SUMMER
A time to be reaping, a time to be sowing
The green leaves of summer are calling me home
It was good to be young then, in the season of plenty
When the catfish were jumping as high as the sky.

A time just for planting, a time just for plowing
A time to be courting a girl of your own
T'was so good to be young then, to be close to the earth
And to stand by your wife, at the moment of birth.

A time to be reaping, a time to be sowing
A time just for living, a place for to die.
T'was so good to be young then, to be close to the earth
Now the green leaves of summer are calling me home

T'was so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
Now the green leaves of summer are calling me home

GREENSLEEVES
Alas, my love, you do me wrong, to cast me off so discourteously,
For I have loved you, oh so long, delighting in your company.
	Greensleeves was all my joy, Greensleeves was my delight
                Greensleeves was my heart of gold, and who, but my Lady Greensleeves

GREENSTAMPS
I found my love in a grocery shop, selling pickles and egg-plants and bottles of pop;
She asked me to try her asparagus tips, and I fell for the smile on her ruby red lips.
                  Green stamps were all she gave, green stamps were all I took,
	  Green stamps were all I  saved, so I pasted them all in my green stamp book.
I'd go every day just to gaze at her face, and in no time at all I had bought out the place.
Tho' ne'er did I e'er taste her ruby red lips, I own four thousand cans of asparagus tips.
     CHORUS ("Green stamps . . .")
When-ever I'm lonely or tired or blue, I go to my bookshelf and here's what I do:
I reach for that book and then with loving care, I count every green stamp that's pasted in there.
     CHORUS ("Green stamps . . .")

A GROOVY KIND OF LOVE
When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue
When you're close to me, I can feel your heartbeat
I can hear you breathing in my ear
	Wouldn't you agree? Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love
	We've got a groovy kind of love
Anytime you want to, you can turn me on to anything you want to, anytime at all
When I taste your lips, oh, I start to shiver, can't control the quivering inside
	Wouldn't you agree? Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love
	We've got a groovy kind of love

	When I'm in your arms, nothing seems to matter
	If the world would shatter, I don't care
	Wouldn't you agree? Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love
	We've got a groovy kind of love
	We've got a groovy kind of love

GUILTY
Is it a sin? Is it a crime? Loving you dear like I do.
If it's a crime then I'm guilty, guilty of loving you.

Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you, dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty, guilty of dreaming of you
	What can I do? What can I say, after I've taken the blame?
	You say you're through, you'll go your way, but I'll always feel just the same.
Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong, loving you dear like I do.
If it's a crime, then I'm guilty, guilty of loving you.

THE GUITAR MAN
Who draws the crowd and plays so loud,  baby it's the guitar man.
Who's gonna steal the show, you know,  baby it's the guitar man,
He can make you love, he can make you cry,  he will bring you down, then he'll get you high
Somethin' keeps him goin', miles and miles a day to find another place to play.

Night after night who treats you right, baby it's the guitar man
Who's on the radi-o, you go listen to the guitar man
Then he comes to town, and you see his face, and you think you might like to take his place
Somethin' keeps him driftin' miles and miles away, searchin' for the songs to play.
	Then you listen to the music and you like to sing a-long,
	You want to get the meaning out of each and ev'ry song
	Then you find yourself a message and some words to call your own and take them home.                                                                                                                                                                                     He can make you love, he can get you high, he will bring you down, then he'll make you cry
Somethin' keeps him movin', but no one seems to know what it is that makes him go.
	Then the lights begin to flicker and the sound is getting dim
	The voice begins to falter and the crowds are getting thin
	But he never seems to notice he's just got to find an-other place to play,
	Any way, got to play. Any way, He's just got to play.

GYPSY WOMAN
From nowhere through a caravan, around the campfire light
A lovely woman in motion, with hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like those of a cat in the dark
That hypnotized me with love
	She was a gypsy woman, she was a gypsy woman
She danced around and 'round to a guitar melody
From the fire her face was all aglow, how she enchanted me
Oh, how I'd like to hold her near, and kiss and forever whisper in her ear
	I love you gypsy woman, I love you gypsy woman
     All through the caravan, she was dancing with all the men
     Waiting for the rising sun, everyone was having fun
     I hate to see the lady go, knowing she'll never know that I love her, I love her
	She was a gypsy woman, she was a gypsy woman, she was a gypsy woman   (fade)

HANDY MAN
Hey girls, gather 'round, because of what I'm puttin' down- Hey, baby, I'm your handy man.
I'm not the kind that uses pencils or rule, I'm handy with love, and I'm no fool,
I fix broken hearts, I know I really can.
	If your broken heart needs repair, then I am the man to see
	I whisper sweet things, you tell all your friends, and they'll come runnin' to me......
Here is the main thing that I want to say, I'm busy twenty-four hours a day
I fix broken hearts, I know that I really can.

HANG ON, SLOOPY
	Hang on Sloopy, Sloopy hang on (X2)
Sloopy lives in a very bad part of town, and everybody, yeah, tries to put my Sloopy down
Sloopy, I don't care what your daddy do, 'cause you know, Sloopy, girl, I'm in love with you
	And so I sing out, Hang on, Sloopy, Sloopy hang on
	Hang on Sloopy, Sloopy hang on
Sloopy, let your hair down girl, let it hang down on me
Sloopy, let your hair down girl, let it hang down on me
	Come on, Sloopy, well come on, Sloopy  (X2)
Well, it feels so good. You know it feels so good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, Sloopy
Shake it, Shake it, Shake it Yeah
	Hang on Sloopy, Sloopy hang on (X3)

HANUKKAH IN SANTA MONICA
I'm spending Hanukkah in Santa Monica, wearing sandals, lighting candles by the sea.
I spent Shavuos in East Saint Louis, a charming spot, but clearly not the spot for me.
Those eastern winters, I can't endure 'em, so every year I pack my gear and come out here for Purim.

Rosh Hashana I spend in Arizona, and Yom Kippah way down in Mississippah.
But in December there's just one place for me:
Amid the California flora I'll be lighting my menorah.
Like a baby in its cradle I'll be playing with my dreidel,
Here's to Judas Maccabeus, boy if he could only see us,
Spending Hanukkah, in Santa Monica, by the Sea!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SWEET SIXTEEN
	Tra-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, happy birthday, sweet sixteen
	Tra-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, happy birthday, sweet sixteen
Tonight's the night I've waited for, because you're not a baby anymore
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen, happy birthday, sweet sixteen
What happened to that funny face? My little tomboy now wears satins and lace
I can't believe my eyes, you're just a teenage dream, happy birthday, sweet sixteen
	When you were only six, I was your big brother
	Then when you were ten, we didn't like each other
	When you were thirteen, you were my funny valentine
 	But since you've grown up, your future is sewn up, From now on you're gonna be mine, so...
If I should smile with sweet surprise it's just that you've grown up before my very eyes
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen, happy birthday, sweet sixteen
         (Repeat last two lines, and finish with "tra-la-la's")

HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN
	So long sad times, go long bad times, we are rid of you at last
	Howdy, gay times, cloudy gray times, you are now a thing of the past
Happy days are here again, the  skies above are clear again
So let's sing a song of cheer again, happy days are here again
Altogether, shout it now, there's no one who can doubt it now
So let's tell the world about it now, happy days are here again
	Your cares and troubles are gone, there'll be no more from now on, from now on
Happy days are here again, the  skies above are clear again
So let's sing a song of cheer again, happy days are here again
So let's sing a song of cheer again, happy days are here again

HAPPY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BABY
Happy, happy birthday, baby, although you're with somebody new.
Thought I'd drop a line to say that I wish this happy day would find me beside you.

Happy, happy birthday, baby, no, I can't call you my baby.
Seems like years ago we met, on a day I can't forget, 'cause that's when we fell in love.
	Do you remember the names we had for each other?
	You were my "pretty," I was your "baby," how could we say goodbye?
Hope I didn't spoil your birthday, I know I'm acting kinda crazy
So I'll close this note to you, with good luck and wishes too
Happy, happy, birthday, baby.

HAPPY TODAY, SAD TOMORROW
Now, I'm happy today, but I'm sad tomorrow. What a life for me.
Monday's gladness, Tuesday's sorrow, oh, the next day is full of ecstasy
Oh, now, I never know what the night will bring, when I awake each morn at the dawn
Whether I must cry, or whether I must sing, oh, Lord, why was I born?
          My heart is full of devotion, but through cloudy skies, I now realize
          Mmm, now, you control my every emotion, mmm, with just one look into your lovely eyes
Now, I'm happy today, but I'm sad tomorrow. What a life for me.
Monday's gladness, Tuesday's sorrow, but the next day is full of ecstasy

HAPPY TOGETHER
Imagine me and you, I do, I think about you day and night, it's only right
To think about the girl you love, and hold her tight, so happy together
If I should call you up, invest a dime, and you say you belong to me and ease my mind
Imagine how the world would be, so very fine, so happy together
            I can see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life
           When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life.
Me and you and you and me, no matter how they toss the dice, it has to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me, so happy together,
	I can see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life
           When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life........
 Me and you and you and me, no matter how they toss the dice, it has to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me, so happy together,
So happy together, so happy together, how is the weather, so happy together!

HAPPY TRAILS
Happy trails to you, until we meet again. Happy trails to you, keep smiling on 'til then
Who cares about the clouds when we're together. Just sing a song and bring the sunny weather.
Happy trails to you 'til we meet again.

HAPPY XMAS  (War Is Over)
So this is Christmas and what have you done
Another year over, a new one just be-gun
	And so this is Christmas, I hope you have fun
	The near and the dear ones, the old and the young
		A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
		Let's hope it's a good one without any fears
And so this is Christmas for weak and for strong
The rich and the poor ones, the road is so long
	And so happy Christmas for black and for white
	For yellow and red ones let's stop all the fights
		A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
		Let's hope it's a good one without any fears
		Let's hope it's a good one without any fears

HARBOR LIGHTS
I saw the harbor lights, they only told me we were parting
The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me
I watched the harbor lights, how could I help if tears were starting?
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silvery sea
	I longed to hold you near and kiss you just once more
	But you were on the ship and I was on the shore
Now I know lonely nights, for all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me
	I longed to hold you near and kiss you just once more
	But you were on the ship and I was on the shore
Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whisp'ring
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me

A HARD DAY'S NIGHT
It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say you're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone you know I feel okay
	When I'm home everything seems to be right
	When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah
It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do will make me feel alright
You know, I feel alright, you know, I feel alright

HARD HEADED WOMAN
Well, a hard headed woman, a soft hearted man
Been the cause of trouble ever since the world began. Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard headed woman been a thorn in the side of man.

Now, Adam told to Eve, "Listen here to me,
Don't you let me catch you messin' round that apple tree." Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard headed woman been a thorn in the side of man.

Now Samson told Delilah, loud and clear,
"Keep your cotton pickin' fingers out my curly hair." Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard headed woman been a thorn in the side of man.

I heard about a king who was doin' swell
Till he started playing with that evil Jezebel. Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard headed woman been a thorn in the side of man.

I got a woman, a head like a rock.
If she ever went away, I'd cry around the clock. Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard headed woman been a thorn in the side of man.
A hard...headed..woman. been a thorn. in the side of man.

HARLEM NOCTURNE
Deep music fills the night, Deep in the heart of Harlem
And, though the stars are bright, the darkness is taunting me

Oh, what a sad refrain, a nocturne, born in Harlem
That melancholy strain forever is haunting me
     The melody clings around my heart strings. It won't let me go when I'm lonely
     I hear it in dreams, and somehow it seems it makes me weep, and I can't sleep

     An indigo tune, it sings to the moon, the lonesome refrain of a lover
     The melody sighs, it laughs and it cries, a moan in blue that wails the long night through
Then, with the dawn it's gone, the melody lives ever
For lonely hearts to learn of love in a Harlem nocturne

HAVA NAGILA
Hava nagila, hava nagila, hava nagila v'nis-m'cha
Hava nagila, hava nagila, hava nagila v'nis-m'cha
Hava n'ra-n'na, hava n'ra-n'na, hava n'ra-n'na v'nis-m'cha
Hava n'ra-n'na, hava n'ra-n'na, hava n'ra-n'na v'nis-m'cha
U-ru uru a-chim, u-ru a-chim, b'lev sa-may-ach, u-ru a-chim, b'lev sa-may-ach
U-ru a-chim b'lev sa-may-ach u-ru a-chim b'lev sa-may-ach
U-ru a-chim, u-ru a-chim b'lev sa-may-ach!

HAVE I TOLD YOU LATELY THAT I LOVE YOU
Have I told you lately that I love you,  could I tell you once again somehow
Have I  told with all my heart and soul how I adore you?
Well, darling, I'm telling you now.
Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping, every dream, I dream of you some how
Have I told you why the nights are long when you're not with me,
Well, darling, I'm telling you now.
	My heart would break in two if I should lose you. I'm no good without you anyhow
	Oh, have I told you lately that I love you?
	Well, darling, I'm telling you now.

HAVEN'T GOT TIME FOR THE PAIN
All those crazy nights when I cried myself to sleep
Now melodrama never makes me weep anymore
	'Cause I haven't got time for the pain, I haven't got room for the pain
	I haven't the need for the pain, not since I've known you
You showed me how, how to leave myself behind
How to turn down the noise in my mind
	Now I haven't got time for the pain, I haven't got room for the pain
	I haven't the need for the pain, not since I've known you
	I haven't got time for the pain, I haven't got room for the pain
	I haven't the need for the pain
Suffering was the only thing that made me feel I was alive
Thought that's just how much it cost to survive in this world
'Til you showed me how, how to fill my heart with love
How to open up, and drink in all that white light pouring down from the heavens
	I haven't got time for the pain, I haven't got room for the pain
	I haven't the need for the pain, not since I've known you
	I haven't got time for the pain, I haven't got room for the pain (repeat this line)

HAVEN'T WE MET
I've ordered some rain for tomorrow, the sky will be sunny but wet
When out of nowhere you're suddenly there,
And I say, "Yeah, pardon me, haven't we met?"
I've ordered some sunshine with showers, and I've got my scenery set
Right there with a thump our umbrellas gonna bump
And I say, "Yeah, yeah, pardon me haven't we met?"
	Accidents can happen, and into one I'm gonna slide
	There's a good chance to get my hands on a little romance
	When two hearts collide.
And I know that's just how it happened when Romeo met Juliet
Somewhere I read that old Romeo said, "Yeah, pardon me, haven't we met?"

HAVE YOU EVER BEEN LONELY
Have you ever been lonely, have you ever been blue
Have you ever loved someone, just as I love you
	Can't you see that I'm sorry for each mistake I've made
	Can't you see I've changed, dear, can't you see that I've paid
Oh, be a little forgiving, take me back in your heart
How can I go on living, now that we're apart
	If you knew what I've been through, you would know why I ask you
	Have you ever been lonely, have you ever been blue

HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS
Have  yourself a merry little Christmas, let your heart be light,
From now on our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas, make the Yuletide gay,
From now on, our troubles will be miles away.
Here we are as in olden days, happy golden days of yore,
Faithful friends who are dear to us, gather near to us once more.
Through the years we all will be together, if the fates allow,
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough,
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now.

HAVE YOU SEEN HER
Oh, I see her face everywhere I go, on the street, and even at the picture show
Have you seen her, tell me, have you seen her?
Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow, in the sweet music on my radio
Have you seen her, tell me, have you seen her?
	        Why, oh, why did she have to leave and go a-way, oh, oh, oh, oh
	         I've been used to havin' someone to lean on, and I'm lost, baby, I'm lost
Oh, she left her kiss up-on my lips, but left that break within my heart
Have you seen her, tell me, have you seen her?
Oh, I see her hand reaching out to me, only she can set me free
Have you seen her, tell me, have you seen her?
	        Why, oh, why did she have to leave and go a-way, oh, oh, oh, oh
	         I've been used to havin' someone to lean on, and I'm lost, baby, I'm lost

HAWAIIAN SUNSET
Hawaiian sunset peeping from the sea, smiles and says Aloha, to his sweetheart Hawaii

The drowsy islands slumber one by one, close their sleepy eyelids,  say goodnight to the sun
	Then Hawaii, like millions of times before, blossoms in her lover's arms once more
Too soon the sunrise will wake her from her sleep, so until tomorrow, sleep, Hawaii, sleep.
	Then Hawaii, like millions of times before, blossoms in her lover's arms once more
Too soon the sunrise will wake her from her sleep, so until tomorrow, sleep, Hawaii, sleep.
So until tomorrow, sleep, Hawaii, sleep.

THE HAWAIIAN WAR CHANT
There's a sunny little funny little melody that was started by a native down in Waikiki
He would gather a crowd...down beside the sea... and they'd play his gay Hawaiian chant
Soon the other little natives started singin' it and the hula, hula maidens started swingin' it
Like a tropical storm, that's the way it hit, funny little gay Hawaiian chant.
	Ow    way    tah   Tu-a-lan,     me      big      bad     fightin' man.
Tho' it started on an island down Hawaii way it's as popular in Tennessee or I-o-way,
If you wander into... any cabaret.....you will hear this gay Hawaiian chant.
	Ow    way    tah   Tu-a-lan,     me       big     bad     fightin' man.   (X2)

HAWAIIAN WEDDING SONG
This is the moment I've waited for.  I can hear my heart singing, soon bells will be ringing.
This is the moment of sweet aloha.
I will love you longer than forever, promise me that you will leave me never.
Here and now, dear, all my love I vow, dear.
Promise me that you will leave me never, I will love you longer than forever
Now that we are one, clouds won't hide the sun.
Blue skies of Hawaii smile on this, our wedding day.
I do (I do) love you (love you) with all my heart.

HE AIN'T HEAVY, HE'S MY BROTHER
The road is long, with many a winding turn,
That leads us to who knows where, who knows where,
But I'm strong, strong enough to carry him. He ain't heavy, he's my brother,
So on we go, his welfare is my concern, no burden is he to bear, we'll get there,
For I know, he would not encumber me. He ain't heavy, he's my brother,
	If I'm laden at all, I'm laden with sadness,
    	That everyone's heart, isn't filled, with the gladness, of love, for one an-other.
It's a long long road, from which there is no return,
While we're on the way, to there, why not share,
And the load, doesn't weigh me down, at all, He ain't heavy, he's my brother,
He's my brother, he ain't heavy, he's my brother, he ain't heavy, he's my brother,

HEARTACHES
Heartaches, heartaches, my loving you meant only heartaches
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me, I can't believe it's just a burning memory
Heartaches, heartaches, what does it matter how my heart breaks?
I should be happy with someone new, but my heart aches for you.

HEARTACHE TONIGHT
Somebody's gonna hurt someone before the night is through.
Somebody's gonna come undone, there's nothin' we can do
Everybody wants to touch somebody, if it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance, and make it come out right
	There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know
	There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know, Lord, I know.
Some people like to stay out late, some folks can't hold out that long
But nobody wants to go home now, there's too much goin' on
This night is gonna last forever. Last all, last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up, the radio is gonna play that song
	There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know
	There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know, Lord, I know.
	There's gonna be a heartache tonight, the moon's shinin' bright,
	So turn out the light, and we'll get it right
	There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache to night, I know
Somebody's gonna hurt someone (somebody) before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone, there's nothin' we can do
Everybody wants to touch somebody, if it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance, and make it come out right
	There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know
	There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know, let's go.
Well, we can beat around the bushes; we can get down to the bone
We can leave it in the parkin' lot, but either way
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know, oh, I know
There'll be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know

HEART AND SOUL
Heart and soul, I fell in love with you heart and soul, the way a fool would do
Madly, because you held me tight and stole a kiss in the night.
Heart and soul, I begged to be adored; lost control, and tumbled overboard,
Gladly, that magic night we kissed, there in the moon-mist.
	Oh, but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling
	Never before were mine so strangely willing. But now I see what one embrace can do
Look at me, it's got me loving you
Madly, that little kiss you stole held all my heart and soul.

HEARTBREAK HOTEL
Well, since my baby left me, I've found a new place to dwell.
It's down at the end of lonely street,  at heartbreak hotel, where I'll be
	I'll be so lonely baby, well, I'm so lonely, I'll be so lonely I could die.
Although its always crowded, you still can find some room.
For broken hearted lovers to cry away their gloom.
	Oh, they're so lonely baby, oh, so lonely, oh, so lonely they could die.
Well, the bell hop's tears keep flowing, and the desk clerk's dressed in black.
Well they been so long on Lonely Street, they will never, ever look back.
	Oh, they're so lonely baby, they're so lonely, well they're so lonely they could die.
Well now, if your baby leaves you, and you've got a tale to tell.
Just take a walk down lonely street,  to heartbreak hotel.
	Where you will be, you'll be so lonely, baby, you'll be so lonely, you'll be so lonely, you could die
Although its always crowded, you still can find some room.
For broken hearted lovers to cry away their gloom.
	Oh, they're so lonely baby, oh, so lonely, they'll be so lonely they could die.

HEART OF MY HEART
"Heart of My Heart," I love that melody.
"Heart of My Heart," brings back fond memories.
When we were kids on the corner of the square
We were rough and ready guys, but, oh, how we could harmonize
"Heart of My Heart, meant friends were dearer then (friends were dearer then)
Too bad we had to part.
I know a tear would glisten, if once more I could listen
To that gang that sang Heart of My Heart, Heart of My Heart,
To that gang that sang Heart of My Heart, Heart of My Heart,
To... that.. gang.. that.. sang.. Heart of My Heart.

THE HEART OF ROCK AND ROLL
     New York, NY is everything they say and no place that I'd rather be
     Where else can you do a half a million things all at a quarter to three?
     When they play their music, oooh that modern music, they like it with a lot of style
     But it's still that same old back beat rhythm that really, really drives 'em wild
          They say the heart of R&R is still beatin', and from what I've seen I believe 'em
          Now the old boy may be barely breathin', but the heart of R&R, heart of R&R is still beatin'
     L.A., Hollywood, and the Sunset Strip is something everyone should see
     Neon lights and the pretty, pretty girls, all dressed so scantily
     When they play their music, that hard rockin' music, they like it with a lot of flash
     But it's still that same old back beat rhythm that really, really kicks 'em in the ----
          They say the heart of R&R is still beatin', and from what I've seen I be-lieve 'em
          Now the old boy may be barely breathin', but the heart of R&R, heart of R&R is still beatin'
D.C., San Antone, and the Liberty Town, Boston and Baton Rouge
Tulsa, Austin, Oklahoma City, Seattle, San Francisco too
Everywhere there's music, real live music, bands with a million styles
But it's still the same old rock and roll music that really, really drives 'em wild
          They say the heart of R&R is still beatin', and from what I've seen I believe 'em
          Now the old boy may be barely breathin', but the heart of R&R, heart of R&R is still beatin'

HEART OF THE NIGHT
In the heart of the night, in the cool southern rain
There's a full moon in sight, shinin, down on the Pontchartrain

And the river she rises, just like she used to do
She's so full of surprises, she reminds me of you
   In the heart of the night. In the heart of the night
   In the heart of the night, oh, down in New Orleans
There's a night bird singing right on through till the dawn
And the streets are still ringing with people carrying'on

Oh, it's been so long waiting, just to be here again
Anticipating all the time I could spend
   In the heart of the night. In the heart of the night
   In the heart of the night
	And I trust in your love never fallin' down
	I trust in your love, just like I do in this town
	Oh, never fallin' down, oh, never fallin' down
In the heart of the night, in the cool fallin' rain
There's a full moon in sight, shinin' down on the Pontchartrain
And the river she rises, just like she used to do
She's so full of surprises, she reminds me of you
   In the heart of the night. In the heart of the night
   In the heart of the night, oh, down in New Orleans
I'm so glad to be back in New Orleans
Please don't wake me, don't shake me, if it's only, if it's only just a dream
'Cause it's the only place I can face, a place that feels so right
Below that Dixie moon, and lovin' you, in the heart of the night

HEAVE HO, MY LADS, HEAVE HO
Heave Ho! My Lads, Heave Ho! It's a long, long way to go.
It's a long, long pull with our hatches full,
Braving the wind, braving the sea, fighting the treacherous foe;
Heave Ho! My lads, Heave Ho! Let the sea roll high or low.
We can cross any ocean, sail any river. Give us the goods and we'll deliver,
Damn the submarine! We're the men of the Merchant Marine!

HE'LL HAVE TO GO
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone, let's pretend that we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go

Whisper to me tell me do you love me true, or is he holding you the way I do
Though love is blind make up your mind I've got to know
Should I hang up or will you tell him he'll have to go
	You can't say the words I want to hear, while you're with another man
	Do you want me? Answer yes or no, darling, I will understand
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone, let's pretend that we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go

HELLO, DOLLY
Hello, Dolly, well Hello, Dolly, it's so nice to have you back where you belong.
You're looking swell, Dolly, I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin' , you're still crowin' , you're still goin' strong.
We feel the room swaying for the band's playing
One of your old favorite songs from way back when
So, take her wrap, fellas, find her an empty lap, fellas,
Dolly, I'll never go away again.

HELLO! MA BABY
Hello, my baby, hello, my honey, hello my ragtime gal
Send me a kiss by wire; baby my heart's on fire
If you refuse me, honey, you'll lose me, then you'll be left alone
Oh baby, telephone, and tell me I'm your own.

TOOT, TOOT, TOOTSIE!
Toot, Toot, Tootsie, goodbye, Toot, Toot, Tootsie don't cry
The choo choo train that takes me, away from you no words can tell how sad it makes me
Kiss me, Tootsie, and then, do it over again.
Watch for the mail, I'll never fail, if you don't get a letter then you'll know I'm in jail.
Toot, toot, Tootsie, don't cry, Toot, Toot, Tootsie, goodbye.

HELLO, MARY LOU
	Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart, sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you.
	I knew, Mary Lou, we'd never part, so hello, Mary Lou, goodbye heart
You passed me by one sunny day, flashed those big brown eyes my way
And oo I wanted you forever more
Now I'm not one that gets around, I swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did meet you before, I said.... (Hello, Mary Lou...)

I saw your lips I heard your voice, believe me I just had no choice
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away
I thought about a moonlit night, my arms around you good an' tight
That's all I had to see for me to say... (Hello, Mary Lou...)

HELLO MUDDAH, HELLO FADDUH
Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh, here I am at Camp Granada
Camp is very entertaining, and they say we'll have some fun if it stops raining.
I went hiking with Joe Spivey, he developed poison ivy.
You remember Leonard Skinner? He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner.

All the counselors hate the waiters, and the lake has alligators
And the head coach wants no sissies, so he reads to us from something called "Ulysses."
Now I don't want this should scare ya, but my bunkmate has malaria.
You remember Jeffrey Hardy? They're about to organize a searching party.
	Take me home, oh Muddah, Fadduh, take me home, I hate Granada.
	Don't leave me out in the forest where I might get eaten by a bear.
	Take me home, I promise I will not make noise or mess the house with other boys
	Oh please don't make me stay, I've been here one whole day.
Dearest Fadduh, darling Muddah, how's my precious little bruddah?
Let me come home if you miss me-I would even let Aunt Bertha hug and kiss me.
Wait a minute-it stopped raining. Guys are swimming, guys are sailing.
Playing baseball-gee, dat's bettah! Muddah, Fadduh, kindly disregard this lettah!

HELLO, YOUNG LOVERS
Hello young lovers who ever you are, I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight, I've been in love like you

Be brave young lovers and follow your star, be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight, I've been in love like you
	I know how it feels to have wings on your heels, and to fly down the street in a trance
	You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet, and you meet not really by chance
Don't cry, young lovers, whatever you do, don't cry because I'm alone
All of my memories are happy tonight, I've had a love of my own
	I've had a love of my own like yours, I've had a love of my own

HE LOVES AND SHE LOVES
He loves, and she loves, and they love, so why can't you love, and I love  too?
Birds love, and bees love, and whispering trees love, and that's what we both should do.
       I always knew someday you'd come along, we'll make a twosome that just can't go wrong,
So, darling, he loves, and she loves, and they love, so won't you love me as I love you?

HELP!
Help, I need some-body,  Help, not just anybody, Help, you know I need someone, Help!
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any    way
But now these days are gone I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the door
	Help me if you can I'm feelin' down... and I   do appreciate your  bein' 'round
	Help me get my feet back on the ground; won't you please, please help me.
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done be-fore.
	Help me if you can I'm feelin' down...  and I  do appreciate you bein' 'round
	Help me get my feet back on the ground
	Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me......oooooo.

HELP ME MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT
Take the ribbon from your hair, shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin, like the shadows on the wall.
Come and lay down by my side, till the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time, help me make it through the night.
	I don't care who's right or wrong, I don't try to under-stand
	Let the devil take tomorrow, Lord, tonight I need a friend.
Yesterday is dead and gone, and tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone, help me make it through the night.

HELP YOURSELF
Love is like candy on a shelf. You want to taste, and help yourself
The sweetest things are there for you
Help yourself, take a few, that's what I want you to do
We're always told repeatedly, the very best in life is free
And if you want to prove it's true
Baby, I'm telling you, this is what you should do
	Just help yourself to my lips, to my arms, just say the word, and they are yours
	Just help yourself to the love in my heart, your smile has opened up the door
	The greatest wealth that exists in the world could never buy what I can give
	Just help yourself to my lips, to my arms, and then let's really start to live
My heart has love enough for two, more than enough for me and you
I'm rich with love, a millionaire, I've so much, it's unfair
Why don't you take a share
	Just help yourself to my lips, to my arms, just say the word, and they are yours
	Just help yourself to the love in my heart, your smile has opened up the door
	The greatest wealth that exists in the world could never buy what I can give
	So, help yourself to my lips, to my arms, and then let's really start to live

HENRY THE EIGHTH
I'm Enery the Heighth I am, Enery the Heighth I am, I am
I got married to the widow next door, she's been married seven times before.
Any every one was an Enery, she wouldn't have a Willy or a Sam  (NO SAM!)
I'm er heighth old man I'm Enery, Enery the Heighth I am.
	SPOKEN:  "Second verse, same as the first!"

HERE COMES MY BABY
In the midnight, moonlight hour, I'll be walkin' a long and lonely mile
And every time I do, I keep seein' this picture of you
	Here comes my baby, here she comes now
	And it comes as no surprise to me, with another guy
	Here comes my baby, here she comes now
	Walkin' with a love, with a love that's oh, so fine
	Never to be mine, no matter how I try
I'm still waitin' for your heart, 'cause I'm sure that some day it's gonna start
You'll be mine to hold each day, but 'til then this is all that I can say
	Here comes my baby, here she comes now
	And it comes as no surprise to me, with another guy
	Here comes my baby, here she comes now
	Walkin' with a love, with a love that's oh, so fine
	Never to be mine, no matter how I try

HERE COMES SANTA CLAUS
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his  reindeer are pulling on the rein.
Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright.
Hang your stockings and say your prayers, 'cause Santa Claus comes to-night. Oh...
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle, what a beautiful sight.
He's got a bag that is filled with toys for the boys and girls again
Jump in bed, cover up your head, 'cause Santa Claus comes to-night!    Oh...(repeat 1st verse)

HERE COMES THAT RAINY DAY FEELING AGAIN
Here comes that rainy day feeling again, and soon my tears, they will be falling like rain
It always seems to be a Monday, left over memories of  Sunday,
Always spent with you, before the clouds appeared, and took away my sunshine

Here comes that rainy day feeling again, and I'll be dreaming of you, baby, in vain
Your face is always on my mind, girl, I'm hopin' soon you're gonna find, girl,
Your way back to me, 'cause if you say you'll stay, the rainy days will go away
	Misty morning eyes, I'm tryin' to disguise the way I feel
	But I just can't hide it, people seem to know, the loneliness must show
	I'm thinkin' of my pride, but breakin' up inside, girl
Here comes that rainy day feeling again, and soon my tears, they will be falling like rain
It always seems to be a Monday, left over memories of  Sunday,
Always spent with you, before the clouds appeared, and took away my sunshine
Here comes that rainy day feeling again,  (repeat and fade)

HERE COMES THE SUN
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun, and I say it's all right
	Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
	Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun, and I say it's all right
	Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
	Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun, and I say it's all right
     Sun, sun, sun, here it comes. Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
     Sun, sun, sun, here it comes. Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
     Sun, sun, sun, here it comes. Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
	Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
	Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun, and I say it's all right  (X2)

HERE'S THAT RAINY DAY
Maybe I should have saved those leftover dreams.
Funny, but here's that rainy day.
	Here's that rainy day they told me a-bout
	And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way.
Where is that worn out wish that I threw a-side,
After it brought my love so near?
	Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
	Funny, that rainy day is here.

HERNANDO'S HIDEAWAY
I know a dark, secluded place, a place where no one knows your face!
A glass of wine, a fast embrace, it's called Hernando's Hideaway, a-way, ole!
All you see are silhouettes, and all you hear are castanets
And no one cares how late it gets, not at Hernando's hideaway, a-way, ole!
	At the Golden Finger Bowl or anyplace you go
	You will meet your Uncle Max and everyone you know
	But if you go to the spot that I am thinking of
	You will be free to gaze at me and talk of love
Just knock three times and whisper low, that you and I were sent by Joe
Then strike and match and you will know you're in Hernando's hideaway, a-way, ole!

HERE YOU COME AGAIN
Here you come again, just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door, just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger
Here you come again, just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes, and lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wonderin' how I came to doubt you.
	All you gotta do is smile that smile, and there go all my defenses
	Just leave it up to you, and in a little while
	You're messin' up my mind, and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again, lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know is here you come again, and here I go
	All you gotta do is smile that smile, and there go all my defenses
	Just leave it up to you, and in a little while
	You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again, lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know is here you come again, and here I go,
Here I go, and here I go, and here I go

HER TOWN TOO
She's been afraid to go out. She's afraid of the knock on her door.
There's always a shade of a doubt. She can never be sure.
Who comes to call? Maybe the friend of a friend of a friend, anyone at all.
Anything but nothing again.
	It used to be her town, it used to be her town, too.
	It used to be her town, it used to be her town, too.
Seems like even her old girlfriends might be talking her down.
She's got her name on the grapevine running up and down the telephone line.
Talking about someone said, someone said something about,
something else someone might have said about her.
She always figured that they were her friends but maybe they can live without her.
	It used to be her town, it used to be her town, too.
	It used to be her town, it used to be her town, too.
     Well, people got used to seeing them both together.
     But now he's gone and life goes on, nothing lasts forever, oh no.
She gets the house and the garden, he gets the boys in the band.
Some of them his friends, some of them her friends, some of them understand.
Lord knows that this is just a small town city, yes, and everyone can see you fall.
It's got nothing to do with pity, I just wanted to give you a call.
	It used to be your town, it used to be my town, too.
	You never know till it all falls down, somebody loves you, somebody loves you.
     Darling, somebody still loves you.
     I can still remember her when it used to be her town, too.
	It used to be your town, it used to be my town, too
	You never know till it all falls down, somebody loves you, somebody loves you.

HE WAS A FRIEND OF MINE
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine
Every time I think about him, I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause he was a friend of mine

He died on the road, he died on the road
He just kept on moving, never reaped what he could sow
And he was a friend of mine

I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
'Cause I never had too much money, And I never been quite satisfied
And he was a friend of mine

He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong
A thousand miles from home, and he never harmed no one
And he was a friend of mine

He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine
Every time I hear his name, Lord, I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause he was a friend of mine.

HE WILL BREAK YOUR HEART
	   He don't love you like I love you, if he did, he wouldn't break your heart.
	   He don't love you like I love you, he's trying to tear  us apart.
Fare thee well, I know you're leavin' for the new love that you've found.
The handsome guy that you've been dating, I got a feelin' he's gonna put you down, 'cause
	Chorus
He uses all the great quotations, he says things I wish I could say.
But he's had so many rehearsals, girl, to him it's just a lover's play.
And when the final act is over, and you're left standing all alone.
When he takes his bow and makes his exit, I'll be there to take you home.

HEY, BABY
	Hey, hey, baby, I wanna know, if you'll be my girl
	Hey, hey, baby, I wanna know, if you'll be my girl
When I saw you walkin' down the street, I said that's the kind of gal I'd like to meet
She's so pretty, Lord, she's fine, I'm gonna make her mine, all mine
	Hey, hey, baby, I wanna know, if you'll be my girl
When you turned, and walked away, that's when I wanna say, now
Come on, baby, give me a whirl, I wanna know if you'll be my girl
	Hey, hey, baby, I wanna know, if you'll be my girl
When you turned, and walked away, that's when I wanna say, now
Come on, baby, give me a whirl, I wanna know if you'll be my girl
	Hey, hey, baby, I wanna know, if you'll be my girl

HEY, GIRL
Hey, girl, I want you to know, I'm going to miss you so much if you go (bye bye, baby)
And hey, girl, I tell you no lie, something deep inside of me's going to die (bye bye, baby)
If you say so long (bye bye, baby), if this is goodbye (bye bye, baby)

Hey, girl, this can't be true, how am I supposed to exist without you (bye bye, baby)
Hey, girl, now don't put me on, what's going to happen to me when you're gone (bye bye, baby)
How will I live, how can I go on? How can I go on?  Oh, oh, oh.
	Instrumental interlude
Hey, girl, now sit yourself down, I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground
And beg, beg you to stay. Don't go away......

HEY, GOOD LOOKIN'
Hey, hey, good lookin' - what ya got cookin'? How's about cooking somethin' up with me?
Hey, sweet baby - don't you think maybe we can find us a brand new reci-pe?
	I got a hot rod Ford, and a two dollar bill, and I know a spot right over the hill
	There's soda pop and the dancin's free, so if you wanna have fun, come a-long with me
Hey, hey, good lookin' - what ya got cookin'? How's about cooking somethin' up with me?

I'm free and ready, so we can go steady. How's about saving all your time for me?
No more lookin' - I know I been cookin'. How's about keepin' steady compa-ny?
	I'm gonna throw my date book over the fence, and buy me one for five or ten cents
	I'll keep it till it's covered with age, 'cause I'm writin' your name down on every page
Hey,  hey, good lookin' - what ya got cookin'? How's about cooking somethin' up,
How's about cooking somethin' up, how's about cooking somethin' up with me?

HEY JUDE
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad, take a sad song, and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart, then you can start to make it better

Hey, Jude, don't be afraid, you were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin, then you begin to make it better
	And, anytime you feel the pain, hey, Jude, refrain
	Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
	For, well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
	By making his world a little colder.  Na, na, na,   na, na, na, na
Hey, Jude, don't let me down, you have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart, then you can start to make it better
	So, let it out and let it in, hey, Jude, begin, you're waiting for someone to perform with
	And don't you know that it's just you, hey, Jude, you'll do
	The movement you need is on your shoulder.  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad, take a sad song, and make it better
The minute you let her under your skin, then you begin to make it better

HEY, LOOK ME OVER
Hey, look me over, lend me an ear, fresh out of clover, mortgaged up to here
But don't pass the plate, folks, don't pass the cup
I figure whenever you're down and out, the only way is up
And I'll be up like a rosebud, high on the vine. Don't thumb your nose, bud, take a tip from mine
I'm a little bit short of the elbow room, but let me get me some, and look out, world, here I come

Nobody in the world was ever without a prayer
How can you win the world, if nobody knows you're there
Kid, when you need the crowd, the tickets are hard to sell
Still you can lead the crowd, if you can get up and yell...

HEY, MISTER, THAT'S ME UP ON THE JUKEBO
   Hey, mister, that's me upon the jukebox. I'm the one that's singing this sad song
   Well, I'll cry every time that you slip in one more dime,
   And let the boy sing this sad one, one more time
Southern California is as blue as the boy can be, blue as the deep blue sea
Won't you listen to me now.  I need your golden gated city like a hole in the head
Just like a hole in the head, I'm free!
       (REFRAIN-"Hey, Mister.....")
       I do believe I'm headed home, hey, mister, can't you see that I'm as dry as a bone
       I think I'll spend some time alone, yes, unless you've found a way of squeezing water from a stone
Let the doctor and the lawyer do as much as they can
Let the springtime begin, let the boy become a man
I've done wasted too much time just to sing you this sad song
I've done been this lonesome picker a little too long
   Hey, mister, that's me upon the jukebox. I'm the one that's singing this sad song
   Well, I'll cry every time that you slip in one more dime,
   And let the boy sing this sad one, one more time
   Well, I've been spreading myself thin these days, don't you know, good-bye        (repeat and fade)

HEY, THAT'S NO WAY TO SAY GOODBYE
I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm,
Your hair upon the pillow, like a sleepy golden storm,
Yes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new,
In city and in forest they smiled like me and you,
But now it's come to distances, and both of us must try,
Your eyes are soft with sorrow, hey, that's no way to say good-bye.

I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time,
Walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme
You know my love goes with you as your love stays with me,
It's just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the sea,
But let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie,
Your eyes are soft with sorrow, hey, that's no way to say good-bye.
	(Repeat 1st verse)

HEY THERE
Hey there, you with the stars in your eyes
Love never made a fool of you, you used to be too wise.
	Hey there you on that high flying cloud
	Though she won't throw a crumb to you, you think someday she'll come to you.
Better forget her, her with her nose in the air
She has you dancing on a string, break it and she won't care.
	Won't you take this advice I hand you like a brother
	Or are you not seeing things too clear, are you too much in love to hear
	Is it all going in one ear and out the other.

HEY THERE, LONELY GIRL
	Hey there lonely girl, lonely girl, let me make your broken heart like new

HIGH HOPES
Next time you're found with your chin on the ground
There's a lot to be learned, so look around.
Just what makes that little old ant think he'll move that rubber tree plant
Anyone knows an ant can't move a rubber tree plant.
But he's got high hopes, he's got high hopes, he's got high apple pie in the sky hopes
So any time you're getting' low, 'stead of lettin' go, just remember that ant
Oops! There goes another rubber tree plant.
When trouble calls, and your back's to the wall
There's a lot to be learned, that wall could fall.
Once there was a silly old ram, thought he'd punch a hole in a dam
No one could make that ram scram, he kept buttin' that dam.
'Cause he had high hopes, he had high hopes, he had high apple pie in the sky hopes
So any time you're feelin' bad, 'stead of feelin' sad, just remember that ram
Oops! There goes a billion kilowatt dam.
All problems just a toy balloon, they'll be bursted soon
They're just bound to go pop, oops, there goes another problem kerplop!

THE HOKEY POKEY
You put your right foot in, you put your right foot out
You put your right foot in, and you shake it all about
You do the hokey pokey, and you turn yourself around
That's what it's all about
	You put your left foot in, you put your left foot out
	You put your left foot in, and you shake it all about
	You do the hokey pokey, and you turn yourself around
	That's what it's all about
You put your right hand in, you put your right hand out
You put your right hand in, and you shake it all about
You do the hokey pokey, and you turn yourself around
That's what it's all about
	You put your left hand in, you put your left hand out
	You put your left hand in, and you shake it all about
	You do the hokey pokey, and you turn yourself around
	That's what it's all about
You put your whole self in, you put your whole self out
You put your whole self in, and you shake it all about
You do the hokey pokey, and you turn yourself around
That's what it's all about

HOLD ME, THRILL ME, KISS ME
Hold me, hold me, never let me go until you've told me, told me
What I want to know and then just hold me, hold me
Make me tell you I'm in love with you

Thrill me, thrill me, walk me down the lane where shadows will be, will be
Hiding lovers just the same as we'll be, we'll be, when you make me tell you I love you
	They told me "Be sensible with your new love"
	"Don't be fooled, thinking this is the last you'll find"
	But they never stood in the dark with you, love
	When you take me in your arms, and drive me slowly out of my mind
Kiss me, kiss me, and when you do, I know that you will miss me, miss me
If we ever say "Adieu", so kiss me, kiss me, make me tell you I'm in love with you

Kiss me, kiss me, when you do, I know that you will miss me, miss me
If we ever say "Adieu", so kiss me, kiss me, make me tell you I'm in love with you
Never, never, never let me go, never, never, never let me go never, never, never let me go

THE HOME FIRE
Pardon the smile on my face, my friend, dreamin' of reachin' my journey's end
I'm headin' straight for my heart's desire, gee, it's good to know I'm near the home fire
      All of the folks that I love are there, I got a date with my favorite chair
      With every step, every hope grows higher, didn't know how much I missed the home fire
　　　　The noises, the TV, the rusty old pipes, the cat always teasin' my dog
　　　　The neighbors, the quarrels, the screaming of kids,
　　　　For the first time in years, I'll sleep like a log
     Heaven is waiting for me, my friend, seven or eight dreams around the bend
     And if you're ever in town, inquire, we'll be glad to have you share the home fire

HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS
Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays, 'cause no matter how far away you roam
When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze,
For the holidays, you can't beat home, sweet home
	I met a man who lives in Tennessee, and he was headin' for
	Pennsylvania and some home-made pumpkin pie
	From Pennsylvania, folks are travelin' down to Dixie's sunny shore,
	From Atlantic to Pacific, gee, the traffic is terrific
Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays, 'cause no matter how far away you roam
If you want to be happy in a million ways,
For the holidays, you can't beat home, sweet home

HOME IN PASADENA
Oh, you railway station.  Oh, you pullman train
Here's  my reservation for my destination, far beyond the western plain
To see my home in Pasadena, home where grass is greener
Where honey bees hum melodies and orange trees scent the breeze
I'm gonna be a home-sweet-homer, there I'll settle down
Beneath the palms in someone's arms in Pasadena town
Beneath the palms in someone's arms in PasadenA town

HOME ON THE RANGE
Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam, where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day.
	Home, home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play
	Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day.
How often at night when the heavens are bright with the light of the glittering stars
Have I stood there amazed and asked as I gazed if their glory exceeds that of ours.
	Home, home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play
	Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day.

HOME SWEET HOME
'Mid pleasures and palaces, though we may roam
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home
A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there
Which seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere.
Home, home, sweet, sweet home, there's no place like home

HONEY
I'm in love with you, Honey.  Say you'll love me too, Honey
No one else will do, Honey, seems funny, but it's true
Loved you from the start, Honey. Bless your little heart, Honey.
Every day would be so sunny, Honey, with you.  (X2)

DEAR OLD GIRL
Dear  old girl, the robin sings above you. Dear old  girl, it speaks of how I love  you
	The blinding tears are falling, as I dream of my lost pearl
	And my broken heart is calling, calling for you, dear old girl

HONEY BUN
A hundred and one pounds of fun, That's my little honey bun! Get a load of honey bun to-night.
I'm speakin' of my Sweetie Pie, only sixty inches high, ev'ry inch is packed with dyna-mite!
	Her hair is blond and curly, her curls are hurly-burly.
	Her lips are pips! I call her hips 'Twirly' and 'Whirly.'
She's my baby,  I'm her pap! I'm her booby, she's my trap!
I am caught and I don't wanna run, 'cause I'm havin' so much fun with honey bun!
I am caught and I don't wanna run, 'cause I'm havin' so much fun with honey bun!
Believe me sonny! She's a cookie who can cook you 'till you're done,
Ain't bein' funny! Sonny, put your money on my honey bun!

HONEYCOMB
Well, it's a darn good life, and it's kinda funny
How the Lord made the bee and the bee made the honey
And the honeybee, lookin' for a home, and they called it a honeycomb
And they roamed the world, and they gathered all of the honeycomb into one sweet ball
And the honeycomb from a million trips, made my baby's lips
	Oh, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby, well, Honeycomb, be my own
	Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone, and made a walkin', talkin' Honeycomb
	Well, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby, well, Honeycomb, be my own
	What a darn good life when you got a wife like Honeycomb.....HONEYCOMB
And the Lord said, now that I made a bee, I'm gonna look all around for a green, green tree
And he made a little tree, and I guess you heard, ah, then, well he made a little bird
And they waited all around till the end of Spring, gettin' every note that the birdie'd sing
And they put 'em all into one sweet tone, for my Honeycomb
	Chorus
And the Lord says now that I made a bird, I'm gonna look all 'round for a little ol' word
That sounds about sweet, like "turtledove" and I guess I'm gonna call it "love"
And he roamed the world, lookin' everywhere, gettin' love from here, love from there
And he put it all in a little ol' part of my baby's heart
	Chorus

HONEY PIE
She was a working girl, North of England way. Now she's hit the big time in the USA.
And if she could only hear me, this is what I'd say:

Honey Pie, you are making me crazy, I'm in love but I'm lazy,
So won't you please come home
Honey Pie, my position is tragic, come and show me the magic of your Hollywood song
	You became a legend of the silver screen,
	And now the thought of meeting you makes me weak in the knee
Oh, Honey Pie, you are driving me frantic, sail across the Atlantic, to be where you belong
	Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
	Kindly send her sailing back to me?
Now, Honey Pie, you are making me crazy, I'm in love but I'm lazy,
So won't you please come home

HONEYSUCKLE ROSE
Every honey-bee fills with jealousy, when they see you out with me
I don't blame them, goodness knows, Honeysuckle Rose

When you're passing by, flowers drop and sigh, and I know the reason why
You're much sweeter, goodness knows, Honeysuckle Rose
	Don't buy sugar, you just have to touch my cup
	You're my sugar, it's sweet when you stir it up
When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips, seems the honey fairly drips
You're confection, goodness knows, goodness knows
Such perfection, goodness knows, Honeysuckle Rose

HOOKED ON A FEELING
I can't stop this feeling deep inside of me.
Girl you just don't realize what you do to me.
When you hold me in your arms so tight,
You let me know every-thing's alright.
	I'm ...  hooked on a feeling, I'm high on believing that you're in love with me.
Lips are sweet as candy, the taste stays on my mind.
Girl, you keep me thirsty for another cup of wine!
I got it bad for you, girl, but I don't need no cure.
I'll just stay addicted, and hope I can endure!
All the good love, when we're all alone.
Keep it up, girl, yeah you turn me on.
	I'm ...  hooked on a feeling, I'm high on believing that you're in love with me.
	I'm ...  hooked on a feeling, I'm high on believing that you're in love with me.
	That you're in love with me, that you're in love with me.

HOORAY FOR HOLLYWOOD
Hooray for Hollywood, that screwy, ballyhooey Hollywood
Where any office boy or young mechanic can be a panic, with just a good looking pan
And any barmaid can be a star-maid, if she dances with or without a fan
Hooray for Hollywood, where you're terrific, if you're even good
Where anyone at all from TV's Lassie to Monroe's chassis is equally understood
Go out and try your luck, you might be Donald Duck, Hooray for Hollywood

Hooray for Hollywood, that phoney, super-coney Hollywood
They come from Chillicothes and Padukahs, with their bazookas to get their names up in lights
All armed with photos from local rotos, with their hair in ribbons and legs in tights
Hooray for Hollywood, you may be homely in your neighborhood
But if you think that you can be an actor, see Mr. Factor, he'd make a monkey look good
Within a half an hour, you'll look like Tyrone Power, Hooray for Hollywood

A HORSE WITH NO NAME
On the first part of the journey, I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things, there was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz, and the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry, but the air was full of sound
	I've been through the desert on a horse with no name, it felt good to be out of the rain
	In the desert you can remember your name
	'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
	La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...la, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...
After two days in the desert sun, my skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun, I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed, made me sad to think it was dead
	You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name, it felt good to be out of the rain
	In the desert you can remember your name
	'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
	La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...la, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...
After nine days I let the horse run free, 'cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things, there was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground, and a perfect disguise all above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground, but the humans will give no love
	You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name, it felt good to be out of the rain
	In the desert you can remember your name
	'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
	La, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...la, la, la la la la, la la la, la la...

HOT DIGGITY
	Oh! hot diggity, dog ziggity boom, what'cha do to me,
	It's so new to me, what'cha do to me,
	Hot diggity, dog ziggity boom, what'cha do to me,
	When you're holdin' me tight!
Never dreamed anybody could kiss thata way, bring me bliss thata way, with a kiss thata way!
Never knew that my heart could go zing thata way, ting-a-ling thata way, make me sing thata way!
There's a cute little cottage for two thata way, skies are blue thata way, dreams come true thata way,

What a wonderful feelin' to feel thata way, tell me where have ya been all my life!
Said goodbye to my troubles, they went thata way, ever since you came into my life!
If you say I can share it with you thata way, I'll be happy the rest of my life!
	Oh! hot diggity, dog ziggity boom, what'cha do to me,
	It's so new to me, what'cha do to me,
	Hot diggity, dog ziggity boom, what'cha do to me,
	How my future will shine, from the moment you're mine.

HOUSE AT POOH CORNER
Christopher Robin and I walked along, under branches lit up by the moon
Posing our questions to owl and E-yore,  as our days disappeared all too soon
But I wandered much further to-day than I should
And I can't seem to find my way back to the wood
	So help me if you can I've got to get back to the house at Pooh Corner by one
	You'd be surprised there's so much to be done
               Count all the bees in the hive, chase all the clouds from the sky
	Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh
Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do, got a honey jar stuck on his nose
He came to me asking help and ad-vice, and from here no one knows where he goes
So I sent him to ask of the owl if he's there, how to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear   (chorus)

HOW ABOUT YOU
I like New York in June, how about you? I like a Gershwin tune,  how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due. I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips, how about you?
I'm mad a-bout good books, can't get my fill. And Franklin Roosevelt's looks  give me a thrill
Holding hands in the movie show, when all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it, how about, I like it, how about, I like it, how about you?

HOW CAN I BE SURE
How can I be sure in a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure where I stand with you
Whenever I, whenever I'm away from you
I wanna die 'cause you know I wanna stay with you
How do I know, maybe you're trying to use me, flying too high can confuse me
Touch me but don't take me down.
Whenever I, whenever I'm away from you
My alibi is telling people I don't care for you
Maybe I'm just hangin' around with my head up, upside down
It's a pity I can't seem to find someone who's as pretty and lovely as you
How can I be sure? I really, really, really wanna know. I really, really, really wanna know.
	How's the weather, whether or not we're together, together we'll see it much better
	I'll love you I'll love you forever, you know where I can be found.
How can I be sure in a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure?  I'm sure with you.

HOW CAN YOU MEND A BROKEN HEART
I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do.
I could never see tomorrow, but I was never told about the sorrow.
	And how can you mend a broken heart? How can you stop the rain from falling down?
	How can you stop the sun from shining? What makes the world go 'round?
	How can you mend this broken man? How can a loser ever win?
	Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again.
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow, noone said a word about the sorrow.
	And how can you mend a broken heart? How can you stop the rain from falling down?
	How can you stop the sun from shining? What makes the world go round?
	How can you mend  this broken man? How can a loser ever win?
	Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again.

HOW DEEP IS THE OCEAN
How much do I love you? I'll tell you no lie.  How deep is the ocean, how high is the sky?
How many times a day do I think of you? How many roses are sprinkled with dew?
How far would I travel to be where you are? How far is the journey from here to a star?
And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry? How deep is the ocean, how high is the sky?

HOW HIGH THE MOON
Somewhere there's music, how faint the tune, somewhere there's heaven, how high the moon.
There is no moon above when love is far away too, till it comes true, that you love me as I love you
Somewhere there's music, it's where you are, somewhere there's heaven, how near, how far
The darkest night would shine if you would come to me soon,
Until you will, how still my heart, how high the moon
The darkest night would shine if you would come to me soon,
Until you will, how still my heart, until you will, how still my heart,
Until you will, how still my heart, how high the moon

HOW MUCH IS THAT DOGGIE IN THE WINDOW
How much is that doggie in the window (arf, arf), the one with the waggley tail
How much is that doggie in the window (arf, arf), I do hope that doggie's for sale
	I must take a trip to Cali-fornia, and leave my poor sweetheart a-lone
	If she has a dog she won't be lonesome, and the doggie will have a good home
I read in the papers there are robbers with flashlights that shine in the dark
My love needs a doggie to pro-tect her and scare them away with one bark
	I don't want a bunny or a kitty, I don't want a parrot that talks
	I don't want a bowl of little fishies. She can't take a goldfish for a walk
How much is that doggie in the window (arf, arf), the one with the waggley tail
How much is that doggie in the window (arf, arf)
I do hope that doggie, I do hope that doggie, I do hope that doggie's for sale.

HOW SWEET IT IS (TO BE LOVED BY YOU)
How sweet it is to be loved by you. How sweet it is to be loved by you.
I needed the shelter of someone's arms.....and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs..and there you were
With sweet love and devotion, deeply touching my emotion
	I want to stop and thank you, baby; I just want to stop, and thank you baby.
	How sweet it is to be loved by you.
I close my eyes at night...wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore; everywhere I went, seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days, with a love so sweet in so many ways.
	CHORUS
You were better to me than I was to myself, for me there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop and thank you, baby; I just want to stop, and thank you baby.
How sweet it is to be loved by you.

HUMBLE AND KIND
You know there's a light that glows by the front door, don't forget the key's under the mat
When childhood stars shine, always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your mama says to, visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time, always stay humble and kind
     Hold the door, say "please", say "thank you", don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
     I know you got mountains to climb, always stay humble and kind
     When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you, when the work you put in is realized
     Let yourself feel the pride, but always stay humble and kind
Don't expect a free ride from no one, don't hold a grudge or a chip, and her is why:
Bitterness keeps you from flyin', always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleepin' with someone, and sleepin' with someone you love
"I love you" ain't no pick-up line, so always stay humble and kind
     Hold the door, say "please", say "thank you", don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
     I know you got mountains to climb, but always stay humble and kind
     When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you, when the work you put in is realized
     Let yourself feel the pride, but always stay humble and kind
When it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle, shut off the AC, and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine, always stay humble and kind
Don't take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where you're goin', don't forget turn back around
And help the next one in line, always stay humble and kind

A HUNDRED POUNDS OF CLAY
He took a hundred pounds of clay, and then He said, 'Hey, listen.'
I'm gonna fix this-a world today, because I know what's missin'.
Then He rolled his big sleeves up, and a brand-new world began.
He created a woman and a-lots of lovin' for a man, whoa-oh-oh, yes, he did,

With just a hundred pounds of clay, he made my life worth livin'.
And I will thank Him every day for every kiss you're givin'.
And I'll thank Him every night for the arms that are holding me tight.
And He did it all with just a hundred pounds of clay, yes, He did, whoa-oh, yes, He did.
    Now can'tcha just see Him a-walkin' 'round and 'round, pickin' the clay up off the ground?
    Doin' just what He should do, to make a livin' dream like you..
He rolled His big sleeves up, and a brand new world began.
He created a woman and a-lots of lovin' for a man, whoa-oh-oh, yes, He did..
With just a hundred pounds of clay,
People let me tell you what He did, with just a hundred pounds of clay   (X2)

HURT SO BAD
	I know you don't know what I'm goin' through, standing here, looking at you
	Well, let me tell you that it	hurts so bad, it makes me feel so sad
	It makes me feel so bad, to see you a-gain
	Like needles and pins, people say you've been making out okay
	"She's in love, don't stand in her way."
	Well, let me tell you that it	hurts so bad, it makes me feel so sad
                   It's gonna hurt so bad, if you walk a-way
	Why don't you stay and let me make it up to you?  (Stay) I'll do anything you want me to
	You loved me before, please love me a-gain, I can't let you go back to him

	Please don't go, please don't go, oh, hurts so bad, come back, it hurts so bad
	          Don't make it hurt so bad, I'm beggin' you please
	Please don't go, please don't go, oh, hurts so bad, come back, it hurts so bad
	          Don't make it hurt so bad, I'm beggin' you please


HUSH-A-BYE
Hush-a-bye, don't you cry, go to sleepy, little baby.
When you wake you shall have all the pretty little horses.
	Dapples and greys, pintos and bays, all the pretty little horses.
Way down yonder, in the meadow, poor little baby cryin, "mama"
Birds and the butterflies flutter 'round his eyes, poor little baby cryin' "mama"

Hush-a-bye, don't you cry, go to sleepy, little baby.
When you wake you shall have all the pretty little horses.
	Dapples and greys, pintos and bays, all the pretty little horses.
Hush-a-bye, don't you cry, go to sleepy, little baby.

I ALMOST LOST MY MIND
When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind
My head is in a spin since she left me behind

I pass a million people but can't tell who I meet
I pass a million people, I can't tell who i meet
'Cause my eyes are full of tears; where can my baby be?

I went to the Gypsy and had my fortune read
I went to see a Gypsy, I had my fortune read
I hung my head in sorrow when she said what she said

Well, I can tell you, people, the news was not so good
Well, I can tell you, people, the news was not so good
She said, "Your baby has quit you, this time she's gone for good"

I BELIEVE (WHEN I FALL IN LOVE)
Shattered dreams, worthless years, here am I encased inside a hollow shell.
Life began, then was done, now I stare into a cold and empty well.
	The many sounds that meet our ears, the sights our eyes behold.
	Will open up our merging hearts, and feed our empty souls.
		     I believe when I fall in love, with you, it will be forever.
		     I believe when I fall in love, this time it will be forever.
Without despair,  we will share, and the joys of caring will not be replaced.
What has been, must never end, and with the strength we have, won't be erased.
	When the truths of love are planted firm, they won't be hard to find.
	And the words of love I speak to you, will echo in my mind.
		     I believe when I fall in love, with you, it will be forever.
		     I believe when I fall in love, with you, it will be forever.
Come on, let's fall in love;  you're the woman I've been waiting for.
Come on, let's fall in love;  you're the girl that I really adore.
Come on, let's fall in love;  you're the woman I've been waiting for.
Come on, let's fall in love;  you're the girl that I really adore.
Come on, let's fall in love!

I BELIEVE IN MUSIC
I could just sit around making music all day long
As long as I'm making music, I know I can't do nobody wrong
And who knows? Maybe some day I'll come up with a song
That makes people want to stop this fussing and fighting just long enough to sing along
	I believe in music, oh, I, I believe in love,
	I believe in music, oh, I, I believe in love,
Music is love, and love is music, if you know what I mean
And people who believe in music are the happiest people I have ever seen
So clap your hands, stomp your feet, and shake your tambourines
And lift your voices to the sky, tell me what you see.
	I believe in music, oh, I, I believe in love,
	I believe in music, oh, I, I believe in love.
Music is the universal language, and love is the key
To brotherhood, and peace, and understanding, and living in harmony
So take your brother by the hand, and sing along with me
And find out what it really means to feel young and rich and free
	I believe in music, oh, I, I believe in love,
	I believe in music, oh, I, I believe in love.

I BELIEVE IN YOU
You have the cool, clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth
Yet, there's that up-turned chin and the grin of impetuous youth
	Oh, I believe in you, I believe in you
I hear the sound of good solid judgment, whenever you talk
Yet, there's the bold, brave spring of the tiger, that quickens your walk
	Oh, I believe in you, I believe in you
     And when my faith in my fellow man all but falls apart
     I've but to feel your hand grasping mine, and I take heart, I take heart
To see the cool, clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth
Yet, there's that slam-bang tang reminiscent of gin and vermouth
	Oh, I believe in you, I believe in you!

I CALL YOUR NAME
I call your name but you're not there, was I to blame for being unfair,
Oh I can't sleep at night, since you've been gone.
I never weep at night, I can't go on.
	Well don't you know I can't take it. I don't know who can,
	I'm not goin' to mayayake it, I'm not that kind of man.
Oh I can't sleep at night, but just the same,
I never weep at night I call your name, I call your name.

I CAN HELP
If you've got a problem, I don't care what it is. If you need a hand, I can assure you this
I can help, I've got two strong arms, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good, let me help

It's a fact that people get lonely, ain't nothin' new
But a woman like you, baby, shoud never have the blues
Let me help, have a laugh on me, let me help
It would sure do me good to do you good, let me help
	When I go to sleep at night, you're always part of my dream
	Holding me tight, and telling me everything I want to hear
Don't forget me, baby, all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you, if I can do anything at all
Let me help, if your child needs a daddy, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good, let me help
	When I go to sleep at night, you're always part of my dream
	Holding me tight, and telling me everything I want to hear
Don't forget me, baby, all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you, if I can do anything at all
Let me help, if your child needs a daddy, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good, let me help

I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW
I can see clearly now the rain is gone, I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It's gonna be a bright, bright, bright, bright sun shiny day (2X)
I think I can make it now the pain is gone. All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is the rainbow I've been praying for
It's gonna be a bright, bright, bright, bright sun shiny day.
	Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies
	Look straight ahead, there's nothing but blue skies.
(Repeat 1st verse)

I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU
I can't begin to tell you how much you mean to me
My world would end if ever we were through
I can't begin to tell you how happy I would be
If I could speak my mind like others do
	I make such pretty speeches whenever we're apart
	But when you're near, the words I choose refuse to leave my heart
So take the sweetest phrases the world has ever known
And make believe I've said 'em all to you
	I make such pretty speeches whenever we're apart
	But when you're near, the words I choose refuse to leave my heart
So take the sweetest phrases the world has ever known
And make believe I've said 'em all to you

I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH ME
Your eyes are blue, your kisses too, I never knew what they could do
I can't believe that you're in love with me
You're telling everyone I know I'm on your mind each place you go
They can't believe that you're in love with me
	I have always placed you far above me,
	I just can't imagine that you love me
And after all is said and done, to think that I'm the lucky one
I can't believe that you're in love with me

I CAN'T GET STARTED
I've flown around the world in a plane, I've settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted, but can't  get started with you
Around a golf course I'm under par, and all the movies want me to star
I've got a house, a showplace, but I get no place with you.
You're so supreme, lyrics I write of you, scheme just for the sight of you,
Dream both day and night of you and what good does it do?
In nineteen twenty-nine I sold short, in England I'm presented at court
But you've got me down-hearted 'cause I can't get started with you.

I do a hundred yards in ten flat, the Prince of Wales has copied my hat
With queens I've a al carted, but can't get started with you
The leading tailors follow my styles, and toothpaste ads all feature my smiles
The Astorbilts I visit, but say, what is it with you
When we first met, how you elated me, Pet, you devastated me
Yet, now you've deflated me 'till you're my Waterloo
I've sold my kisses at a bazaar, and after me they've named a cigar
But lately how I've smarted, 'cause I can't get started with you.

I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING BUT LOVE
I can't give you anything but love, baby that's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream a while, scheme a while, we're sure to find happiness, and, I guess
All those things you've always pined for
Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, baby; diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby
Till that lucky day, you know darned well, baby, I can't give you anything but love.

I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER
It's a long and dusty road, It's a hot and a heavy load, and the folks I meet ain't always kind
Some are bad and some are good, some have done the best they could
Some have tried to ease my troubled mind
	And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound
	Can't help but wonder where I'm bound
I've been wanderin' through this land just a-doin' the best I can
Tryin' to find what I was meant to do
And the people that I see look as worried as can be, and it looks like they are wonderin' too
	CHORUS
Oh, I had a little gal one time, she had lips like sherry wine
And she loved me till my head went plumb insane
But I was too blind to see she was driftin' away from me
And my good gal went off on the morning train
	CHORUS
And I had a buddy back home, but he started out to roam, and I hear he's out by Frisco Bay
And sometimes when I've had a few, his voice comes ringin' through
And I'm goin' out to see him some old day.
	CHORUS
If you see me passing by and you sit and you wonder why, and you wish that you were rambling too
Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor, lace 'em up and bar the door
Thank your stars for the roof that's over you
	CHORUS  (X2)

I CAN'T HELP MYSELF
Sugar pie, honeybunch, you know that I love you
I can't help myself, I love you, and nobody else
	In and out my life, you come and you go
	Leaving just your picture behind, and I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your finger, or wink your eye, I come a-runnin' to you
I'm tied to your apron strings, and there's nothin' that I can do
             I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself
Sugar pie, honeybunch, I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself, I'm a fool in love, you see
	Want to tell you I don't love you, tell you that we're through, and I've tried
	But every time I see your face, I get all choked up inside
     When I call your name, girl, it starts the flame
     (Burnin' in my heart, tearin' it all apart), no matter how I try, my love I cannot hide
C'mon, Sugar pie, honeybunch, you know that I'm waitin' for you
Can't help myself, I love you, and nobody else
	Sugar pie, honeybunch, do anything you ask me to
	I can't help myself, I want you, and nobody else
Sugar pie, honeybunch, you know that I love you
Can't help myself, no, I can't help myself

I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU
I can't stop loving you, so, I've made up my mind to live in memories of the lonesome times.
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say, so I'll just live my life, in dreams of yesterday.
     Those happy hours, that we once knew, though long ago, still make me blue.
     They say that time heals a broken heart, but time has stood still since we've been apart
I can't stop loving you, so, I've made up my mind to live in memories of the lonesome times.
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say, so I'll just live my life, in dreams of yesterday.

I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY
Look at us baby, up all night, tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who lived through years in the dark?
        Every time I try to walk away, something makes me turn around and stay
        And I can't tell you why
When we get crazy, it just ain't right, girl, I get lonely too
You don't have to worry, just hold on tight, 'cause I love you
       Nothing's wrong as far as I can see, we make it harder than it has to be
       And I can't tell you why, no, baby, I can't tell you why, I can't tell you why

      Every time I try to walk away, something makes me turn around and stay
      And I can't tell you why, no, baby, I can't tell you why
      I can't tell you why, I can't tell you why

I CONCENTRATE ON YOU
Whenever skies look gray to me and trouble begins to brew
Whenever the winter winds become too strong, I concentrate on you
When fortune cries "nay, nay" to me and people declare "You're through"
Whenever he blues become my only song, I concentrate on you.
On your smile so sweet, so tender, when at first my kiss you decline
On the light in your eyes when you surrender, and once again our arms intertwine
And so when wisemen say to me that love's young dream never comes true
To prove that even wisemen can be wrong, I concentrate on you.

I COULD WRITE A BOOK
If they asked me I could write a book about the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met, so the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot is just to tell them that I love you a lot
Then the world discovers, as my book ends, how to make two lovers of friends

I'D DO ANYTHING
I'd do anything, for you dear, anything, for you mean everything, to me
I know that, I'd go anywhere, for your smile, anywhere, for your smile, everywhere, I'd see
	Would you climb a hill?....Anything! Wear a daffo-dil?....Anything!
	Leave me all your will?....Anything! Even fight my Bill?  What fisticuffs?
I'd risk everything, for one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything, (ANYthing?) Anything for you
I'd go anywhere for your smile, anywhere, for your smile, everywhere I'd see
	Would you lace my shoe?...Anything! Paint your face bright blue?...Anything!
	Catch a kangaroo?...Anything!  Go to Timbuktu?....And back again!
I'd risk everything, for one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything, (ANYthing?) Anything for you
Yes I'd do anything, (ANYthing?) Anything for you

I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS
I didn't know what time it was, then I met you
Oh what a lovely time it was, how sublime it was too!

I didn't know what day it was, you held my hand.
Warm like the month of May it was and I'll say it was grand.
	Grand to be alive, to be young, to be mad, to be yours alone!
	Grand to see your face, feel your touch, hear your voice say I'm all your own!
I didn't know what year it was, life was no prize.
I wanted love and here it was shining out of your eyes.
I'm wise and I know what time it is now.

I DIG ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC
I dig rock and roll music, and I love to get the chance to play (and sing it)
I figure it's about the happiest sound goin' down today
　　　　The message may not move me, or mean a great deal to me
	But hey! It feels so groovy to say
I dig the Mamas and the Papas, at "The Trip," Sunset Strip in LA
They got a good thing goin' when the words don't get in the way
	 And when they're really wailin', Michelle and Cass are sailin'
	 Hey! They really nail me to the wall
......Donovan kind of in a dream-like, tripped-out way
His crystal images tell you 'bout a brighter day
	 And when the Beatles tell you, they've got a word "love" to sell you
	 They mean exactly what they say.
I dig rock and roll music, I could really get it on that scene
I think I could say somethin', if you know what I mean
	  But if I really say it, the radio won't play it
	  Unless I lay it between the lines

I'D LIKE TO TEACH THE WORLD TO SING
I'd like to build the world a home and furnish it with love,
Grow apple trees and honey bees and snow-white turtle doves.

I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
I'd like to hold it in my arms and keep it company
   CHORUS:
	That's the song I hear, let the world sing to-day,
	A song of peace that echoes on and never goes away
I'd like to see the world for once all standing hand in hand
And hear them echo thru the hills for peace throughout the land.
	That's the song I hear, let the world sing to-day,
	A song of peace that echoes on and never goes away
I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
I'd like to hold it in my arms and keep it company

I DON'T CARE IF THE SUN DON'T SHINE
The sun contains the ray they label vitamin D. If you lack vitamin D, it's quite alright with me
But I am here to say, that I lack vitamin love, but  I can't get vitamin love with that doggone sun above

I don't care if the sun don't shine, I get my loving in the evening time, when I'm with my baby
It's no fun with the sun around, but I get going when the sun goes down, and I meet my baby.
That's when we kiss and kiss and kiss, and then we kiss some more
Don't ask me how many times we kiss, at a time like this who keeps score
So I don't care if the sun don't shine, I get my loving in the evening time, when I'm with my baby.

I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT YOU
I know a little bit about a lot o' things, but I don't know enough about you.
Just when I think you're mine, you try a different line,
And baby, what can I do?

I read the latest news, no buttons on my shoes, but baby, I'm confused about you.
You get me in a spin, oh, what a stew I'm in,
'Cause I don't know enough about you.
	Jack of all trades, master of none, and isn't it a shame,
	I'm so sure that you'd be good for me, if you'd only play my game!
You know I went to school, and I'm nobody's fool, that is to say until I met you!
I know a little bit about a lot o' things, but I don't know enough about you. (repeat last 4 lines)
	I know a little bit about biology, and a little more about psychology,
	I'm a little gem in geology, but I don't know enough about you.

I DON'T KNOW WHERE I STAND
Funny day, looking for laughter and finding it there
Sunny day, braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair
Picked up a pencil, and wrote "I love you" in my finest hand
Wanted to send it, but I don't know where I stand

Telephone, even the sound of your voice is still new
All alone, in California, and talking to you
And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had planned
I guess it's too early, 'cause I don't know where I stand

Crickets call, courting their ladies in star-dappled green
Thickets tall, until the morning comes up like a dream
All muted and misty, so drowsy now I'll take what sleep I can
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand

I DON'T KNOW WHY
I don't know why I love you like I do, I don't know why, I just do.
I don't know why you thrill me like you do, I don't know why, you just do.
You never seem to want my romancing
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing.
I don't know why I love you like I do, I don't know why, I just do.

I DON'T STAND A GHOST OF A CHANCE
I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
I thought at last I'd found you, but other loves surround you
And I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
	If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
	You might discover that I'm the lover meant for you, and I'd be true
But what's the good of scheming, I know I must be dreaming
For I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you

I DON'T WANT TO SET THE WORLD ON FIRE
I don't want to set the world on fire;
I just want to start a flame in your heart
In my heart I have but one desire, and that one is you, no other will do.
I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim; I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you feel the same,
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me.
I don't want to set the world on fire; I just want to start a flame in your heart,
I just want to start a flame in your heart.

I DON'T WANT TO WALK WITHOUT YOU
I don't want to walk without you, baby, walk without my arm about you, baby
I thought the day you left me behind, I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind
But now I find that I don't want to walk without the sunshine
Why'd you have to turn off all that sunshine
Oh baby, please come back, or you'll break my heart for me
Cause, I don't want to walk with out you, no-siree

I'D LIKE TO TEACH THE WORLD TO SING
I'd like to build the world a home and furnish it with love,
Grow apple trees and honey bees and snow-white turtle doves.
I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
I'd like to hold it in my arms and keep it company
   CHORUS:
	That's the song I hear, let the world sing to-day,
	A song of peace that echoes on and never goes away
I'd like to see the world for once all standing hand in hand
And hear them echo thru the hills for peace throughout the land.  (REPEAT CHORUS AND2ndVERSE)

I'D RATHER BE BLUE OVER YOU
Here I am, there you'll be, miles and miles away from me
I can't see the good in goodbye
Still.... best of friends have to part, don't lose sleep and don't lose heart
No need, so baby don't cry

I'd rather be blue, thinking of you, I'd rather be blue over you
Than be happy with somebody else
	I can't live without ya, outcha, for you I'm strong
	I'm crazy about'cha, outcha magoutcha, don't stay too long
	I need a little ah, little ooh, little oh, and I'm knocking on wood.
	Honey hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, it's so hard to be good
I'd rather be blue, thinking of you, I'd rather be blue over you
Than be happy with somebody else
	Will I be good? Will I be bad? Don't be a fool, you fool.
	My little flat, I'm turning that into a Sunday school
	While you're away, I'm here to say, there'll be no iceman there.
	Singin' the blues I'm gonna use nothin' but Frigidaire.
Still..I'd...rather be blue thinking of you, I'd rather be blue over you
Than be happy with somebody else

I'D RATHER LEAVE WHILE I'M IN LOVE
I'd rather leave while I'm in love, while I still believe the meaning of the word
I'll keep my dreams, and just pretend that you and I are never gonna end
　　　　  Too many times I've seen the rose die on the vine
　　　　  Somebody's heart gets broken, usually it's mine
　　　　  I don't want to take the chance of being hurt again, and you and I can't say goodbye
So, if you wake and find me gone, oh, babe, just carry on, you see, I need my fantasy
I still believe it's best to leave while I'm in love
　　　　  Too many times I've seen the rose die on the vine
　　　　  Somebody's heart gets broken, usually it's mine
　　　　  I don't want to take the chance of being hurt again, and you and I can't say goodbye
So, if you wake and find me gone, oh, babe, just carry on, you see, I need my fantasy
I still believe it's best to leave while I'm in love
I still believe it's best to leave while I'm in love

I'D REALLY LOVE TO SEE YOU TONIGHT
Hello, yeah, it's been a while.  Not much, how 'bout you?
I'm not sure why I called, I guess I really just wanted to talk to you.
And I was thinkin' maybe later on, we could get together for a while
It's been such a long time, and I really do miss your smile
I'm not talkin' 'bout movin' in, and I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around, and I'd really love to see you tonight
We could go walking through a windy park, take a drive along the beach
Or stay at home and watch TV, you see it really doesn't matter much to me
I'm not talkin' 'bout movin' in, and I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around, and I'd really love to see you tonight
	I won't ask for promises, so you don't have to lie
	We've both played that game before: say I love you then say goodbye
I'm not talkin' 'bout movin' in, and I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around, and I'd really love to see you tonight

I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL THE PARTY
I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go, I would hate my disappointment to show,
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear, if she turns up while I'm gone please let me know.
I've had a drink or two and I don't care, there's no fun in what I do if she's not there,
I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long, I think I'll take a walk and look for her.
	Though tonight she's made me sad, I still love her,
	If I find her I'll be glad, I still love her.
I've had a drink or two and I don't care, there's no fun in what I do if she's not there,
I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long, I think I'll take a walk and look for her.

I DON'T WANT TO WALK WITHOUT YOU
I don't want to walk without you, baby, walk without my arm about you, baby
I thought the day you left me behind, I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind
But now I find that I don't want to walk without the sunshine
Why'd you have to turn off all that sunshine
Oh baby, please come back, or you'll break my heart for me
Cause, I don't want to walk with out you, no siree

I FALL TO PIECES
I fall to pieces, each time I see you again.
I fall to pieces how can I be just your friend
You want me to act like we've never kissed,
You want me to forget, pretend we've never met
And I've tried, and I've tried, but I haven't yet,
You walk by, and I fall to pieces.

I fall to pieces, each time someone speaks your name.
I fall to pieces, time only adds to the flame
You tell me to find someone else to love,
Someone who'll love me too, the way you used to do
But each time I go out with someone new,
You walk by, and I fall to pieces.  You walk by, and I fall to pieces

I FEEL A SONG COMING ON
I feel a song coming on, and I'm a-warning you, it's a victorious, happy and glorious new strain
I feel a song coming on, it's a melody full of the laughter of children out after the rain
	You'll hear a tuneful story ringing through you, love and glory, hallelujah
And now that my troubles are gone,
Let those heavenly drums go on drumming, 'cause I feel a song coming on

I FEEL FINE
Baby's good to me, you know, she's happy as can be, you know,
She said so. I'm in love with her and I feel fine.
Baby says she's mine, you know, she tells me all the time, you know,
She said so. I'm in love with her and I feel fine.
	I'm so glad that she's my little girl.
	She's so glad, she's telling all the world
That her baby buys her things, you know, he buys her diamond rings, you know,
She said so. She's in love with me and I feel fine.

I FEEL SO SMOOCHIE
I feel so smoochie, when I hold your hands and look in your eyes
I feel so smoochie when I touch your lips and I realize
That to hold you near makes rainbows appear, and life is just one long kiss
With the moon shining down, and the stars kinda frown
Say golly, just look what we miss

I feel so smoochie, when the night is cool, it's always warm here with you
I feel so smoochie, when a seat for one becomes a love seat for two
Then I'll know my career starts and ends right here, right in your loving arms
Smoochie little girl you, smoochie old character me

I FEEL THE EARTH MOVE
I feel the earth move under my feet, I feel the sky tumblin' down
I feel my heart start to tremblin' whenever you're around
	Ooh, baby, when I see your face, mellow as the month of May
	Oh, darlin', I can't stand it, when you look at me that way
I feel the earth move under my feet, I feel the sky tumblin' down
I feel my heart start to tremblin' whenever you're around
	Ooh, darlin', when I'm near you, and you tenderly call my name
	I know that my emotions are something I just can't tame, I just got to have you, baby
     Ah!  Ah!  Yeah!
I feel the earth move under my feet, I feel the sky tumblin' down, tumblin' down
I feel the earth move under my feet, I feel the sky tumblin' down, tumblin' down
I just lose control, down to my very soul, I get hot and cold, all over, all over, all over, all over
I feel the earth move under my feet, I feel the sky tumblin' down, tumblin' down, etc

I FOUND A MILLION DOLLAR BABY
It was a lucky April shower, it was the most convenient door
I found a million dollar baby in a five and ten cent store
The rain continued for an hour, I hung around for three our four
Around a million dollar baby in a five and ten cent store
	She was selling china, and when she made those eyes
	I kept buying china until the crowd got wise. Incidentally....
If you should run into a shower, just step inside my cottage door
And meet my million dollar baby from the five and ten cent store
	Love comes along like a popular song, any time or anywhere at all.
	Rain  or sunshine, spring or fall.
	Say, you'll never know when it may say hello in a very unexpected place.
	For example, take  my case.
If you should run into a shower, just step inside my cottage door
And meet my million dollar baby from the five and ten cent store

I FOUND A NEW BABY
I found a new baby, I found a new girl. My fashion plate baby has got me awhirl
Her new kind of lovin' done made me her slave.
Her sweet turtle dovin' is 'bout all that I crave
	Sweetest miss, with a kiss full of bliss, can't resist somehow
	Tells me lies, but she's wise, naughty eyes mesmerize, I vow
I don't mean maybe, I had to fall,
I found a new baby, a new baby, that's all
	Sweetest miss, with a kiss full of bliss, can't resist somehow
	Tells me lies, but she's wise, naughty eyes mesmerize, I vow
I don't mean maybe, I just had to fall,
I found a new baby, new baby, that's all
I found a new baby, brand new baby, that's all

I GET A KICK OUT OF YOU
My story is much too sad to be told, but practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case, when I'm out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne. Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So, tell me why should it be true, that I get a kick out of you?
Some get a kick from cocaine. I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too, yet I get a kick out of you
	I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
	I get a kick though it's clear to me you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane. Flying too high with some gal/guy in the sky is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick, it's quite a kick, I get a kick out of you

I GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU VERY WELL
I get along without you very well, of course I do;
Except when soft rains fall and drip from leaves, then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms, of course I do.
But I get along without you very well.

I've forgotten you, just like I should, of course I have;
Except to hear your name, or someone's laugh that is the same.
But I've forgotten you just like I should.
	What a guy!    What a fool am I
	To think my breaking heart could kid the moon.
	What's in store?   Should I 'phone once more?
	No, it's best that I stick to my tune.
I get along without you very well, of course I do;
Except perhaps in spring...but I should never think of spring,
For that would surely break my heart in two.

I GET IDEAS
When we are dancing, and you're dangerously near me, I get ideas, I get ideas.
I want to hold you so much closer than I dare do.
I want to scold you, 'cause I care more than I care to.
And when you touch me, and there's fire in every finger, I get ideas, yes I get ideas.
And after we have kissed goodnight, and still you linger, I kinda think you get ideas too.
	Your eyes are always saying the things you're never saying.
	I only hope they're saying that you could love me too.
	For that's the whole idea, it's true, the lovely idea
	That I've fallen in love with you.

I GOT A NAME
Like the pine trees linin' the windin' road, I've got a name, I've got a name
Like the singin' bird and the croakin' toad, I've got a name, I've got a name
And I carry it with me like my daddy did, but I'm livin' the dream that he kept hid
	Movin' me down the highway, rollin' me down the highway
	Movin' ahead, so life won't pass me by
Like the north wind whistlin' down the sky, I've got a song, I've got a song
Like the whippoorwill and the baby's cry, I've got a song, I've got a song
And I carry it with me, and I sing it loud, if it gets me nowhere, I'll go there proud
	Movin' me down the highway, rollin' me down the highway
	Movin' ahead, so life won't pass me by
Like the fool I am and I'll always be, I've got a dream, I've got a dream
They can change their minds, but they can't change me, I've got a dream, I've got a dream
Oh, I know I could share it, if you want me too, if you're goin' my way, I'll go with you
	Movin' me down the highway, rollin' me down the highway
	Movin' ahead, so life won't pass me by

I GOT IT BAD (AND THAT AIN'T GOOD)
Never treats me sweet and gentle, the way she/he should, I got it bad, and that ain't good
My poor heart is sentimental, not made of wood, I got it bad and that ain't good
	But when the weekend's over, and Monday rolls around
	I end up like I start out, just cryin' my heart out
She/he don't love me like I love her/him, no, nobody could
I got it bad, and that ain't good

Like a lonely weepin' willow who's lost in the wood, I got it bad and that ain't good
And the things I tell my pillow, nobody should, I got it bad, and that ain't good
	Though folks with good intentions, they tell me to save up my tears
	I'm glad I'm mad about her/him, I can't live without her/him
Lord above, make her/him love me the way that she/he should
I got it bad, and that ain't good, I got it bad, and that ain't good

I GO TO PIECES
When I see her comin' down the street, I get so shaky and I feel so weak
I tell my eyes, "Look the other way," but they don't seem to hear a word I say, and I
	Go to pieces, and I wanna hide, go to pieces, and I almost die,
	Every time my baby passes by
I tell my arms, "They'll hold someone new, another love that will be true"
But they don't listen, they don't seem to care, they reach for her, but she's not there, and I
	Go to pieces, and I wanna hide, go to pieces, and I almost die,
	Every time my baby passes by...I remember what she said when she said,
	"Goodbye, baby, we'll meet again soon maybe,
	but until we do, all my best to you." I'm so lonely, think about her only
I go to places we used to go, but I know she'll never show
She hurt me so much inside, now I hope she's satisfied, and I
	Go to pieces, and I wanna hide, go to pieces, and I almost die, every time my baby passes by
	Go to pieces, and I cry, everytime my baby passes by  (X2)

I GOT RHYTHM
	    Days can be sunny with never a sigh. Don't need what money can  buy
	    Birds in the trees sing their day full of songs. Why shouldn't we  sing a-long?
	    I'm chipper all the day, happy with my lot
	    How do I get that way? Look at what I've got:
I got rhythm, I  got  music, I got  my gal, who could ask for anything more?
I  got  daisies in green  pastures, I got my gal, who could ask for anything more?
Old man trouble, I don't mind him, you won't find him 'round my door
I  got starlight, I got sweet dreams, I got my gal, who could ask for anything more?

I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO CHANGE MY PLAN
I guess I'll have to change my plan, I should have realized there'd be another man
I overlooked that point completely, until the big affair began

Before I knew where I was at, I found myself upon the shelf, and that was that
I tried to reach the moon, but when I got there, all that I could get was the air
My feet are back upon the ground, I lost the one girl I'd found

I guess I'll have to change my plan, I should have realized there'd be another man
Why did I buy those blue pajamas before that big affair began?
My boiling point is much too low, for me to try to be a fly lothario
I think I'll crawl right back, and into my shell, dwelling in my personal hell
I'll have to change my plan around, I lost the one girl I'd found
Yes, the one girl I'd found.

I GUESS THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT THE BLUES
Don't wish it away, don't look at it's like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say that things can only get better
And while I'm away, dust out the demons inside, and it won't be long
Before you and me run to the place in our hearts where we hide
	And I guess that's why they call it the blues
	Time on my hands could be time spent with you
	Laughing like children, living like lovers, rolling like thunder, under the covers
	And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Just stare into space, picture my face in your hands
Live for each second, without hesitation, and never forget I'm your man
Wait on me girl, cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you more than I love life itself
	And I guess that's why they call it the blues
	Time on my hands could be time spent with you
	Laughing like children, living like lovers, rolling like thunder, under the covers
	And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Wait on me girl, cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you more than I love life itself
	And I guess that's why they call it the blues
	Time on my hands could be time spent with you
	Laughing like children, living like lovers, rolling like thunder, under the covers
	And I guess that's why they call it the blues  (X3)

I GUESS THE LORD MUST BE IN NEW YORK CITY/EVERYBODY'S TALKIN'
I'll say goodbye to all my sorrow, and by tomorrow I'll be on my way
I guess the Lord must be in New York City

I'm so tired of getting nowhere, seein' my prayers goin' unanswered
I guess the Lord must be in New York City
	Well, here I am, Lord, knockin' at your back door, hmm
	Ain't it wonderful to be where I've always wanted to be?
	For the first time, I'll breathe free here in New York City

Everybody's talkin' at me. I don't hear a word they're sayin', only the echoes of my mind
People stoppin, starin', I can't see their faces, only the shadows of their eyes
I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin', through the pourin' rain
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin' off of the northeast winds, sailin' on a summer breeze,
And skippin' over the ocean like a stone.
Wah, wah wah-wah wah, wah-wah wah-wah, wah wah-wah Wahhh

I HATE TO LOSE YOU
I hate to lose you, I'm so used to you now. Still, I excuse you for breaking your vow
Just like the sunlight, I've found I'm used to havin' you 'round
You're all I've ever been thinkin' of, who am I gonna love, now that you've turned me down?

Just like the rose, dear, that's used to the sun, its petals close, dear, when summer is done
And I'm so used to your kisses, all the others seem strange
Used to your lovin', and I don't wanna change. I hate to lose you, I'm so used to you now.
I hate to lose you, I'm so used to you now.

I HAVE DREAMED
I have dreamed that your arms are lovely, and I have dreamed what a joy you'll be
I have dreamed every word you'll whisper, when you're close, close to me

How you look in the glow of evening, I have dreamed and enjoyed the view
In these dreams I've loved you so, that by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you, I will love being loved by you  (repeat last 2 lines)

I HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE
Ooh, I bet you're wonderin' how I knew 'bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before. Between the two of us guys, you know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say, when I found out yesterday
     Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be mine
     Oh, I heard it through the grapevine, oh, I'm just about to lose my mind
	Honey, honey yeah. (I heard it through the grapevine,
	Not much longer would you be my baby, ooh, ooh)
I know a man ain't supposed to cry, but these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life, you see, 'cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me, yourself, that you love someone else
     Instead, I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be mine
     Oh, I heard it through the grapevine, and I'm just about to lose my mind
	Honey, honey yeah. (I heard it through the grapevine,
	Not much longer would you be my baby)
People say, believe half of what you see, son, and none of what you hear
But I can't help but be confused, if it's true, please tell me, dear
Do you plan to let me go, for the other guy you loved before?
     Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be mine
     Baby, I heard it through the grapevine, I'm just about to lose my mind
	Honey, honey yeah. (I heard it through the grapevine,
	Not much longer would you be my baby)

	Honey, honey, I  know that you're lettin' me go
	Said, I heard it through the grapevine,
     	Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine

I HEAR YOU KNOCKIN'
You went away and left me a long time ago, now you come back knockin' on my door
	I hear you knockin', but you can't come in, I hear you knockin', go back where you been
I begged you not to go but you said goodbye,now you come back telling all your lies
	I hear you knockin', but you can't come in, I hear you knockin', go back where you been
If you had a-listened a long time ago, you wouldn't be going from door to door
	I hear you knockin', but you can't come in, I hear you knockin', go back where you been

I HOPE YOU DANCE
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder, you get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger,
May you never take one single breath for granted, God forbid love ever leave you empty-handed,

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens,
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance:
	I hope you dance....I hope you dance.
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance, never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances, but they're worth takin',
Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth makin',
Don't let some hell bent heart leave you bitter, when you come close to sellin' out reconsider,
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance:
	I hope you dance....I hope you dance.  I hope you dance....I hope you dance.
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens,
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance:
	Dance....I hope you dance. 	I hope you dance....I hope you dance.

I JUST CALLED TO SAY I LOVE YOU
No New Year`s day, to celebrate, no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away.
No first of spring, no song to sing, in fact here`s just another ordinary day.
No April rain, no flowers bloom, no wedding Saturday within the month of June.
But what it is, is something true, made up of these three words that I must say to you.
	I just called to say I love you, I just called to say how much I care.
	I just called to say I love you, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer`s high, no warm July, no harvest moon to light one tender August night.
No autumn breeze,  no falling leaves,  not even time for birds to fly to southern skies.
No Libra Sun, no Hallo-ween, no giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring.
But what it is, though old, so new, to fill your heart like no three words could ever do.
	I just called to say I love you, I just called to say how much I care.
	I just called to say I love you, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart
	I just called to say I love you, I just called to say how much I care.
	I just called to say I love you, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart
 	Of my heart,  of my heart

I JUST CAN'T HELP BELIEVIN'
I just can't help believin', when she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty mornin', and the promise of tomorrow in her eyes
And I just can't help believin', when she's lyin' close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sighs
      This time the girl is gonna stay, this time the girl is gonna stay, for more than just a day
I just can't help believin', when she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless, that my fingers fold around it like a glove
And I just can't help believin', when she's whisperin' her magic
And the tears are shinin' honey sweet with love
      This time the girl is gonna stay, this time the girl is gonna stay, for more than just a day
I just can't help believin', no I just can't help believin'
I just can't help believin', no I just can't help believin'

I JUST FALL IN LOVE AGAIN
Dreaming, I must be dreaming, or am I really lying here with you?
Baby, you take me in your arms
And though I'm wide awake, I know my dream is coming true
	And, oh, I just fall in love again, just one touch and then it happens every time
	There I go, I just fall in love again and when I do
	I can't help myself, I fall in love with you
Magic, it must be magic, the way I hold you and the night just seems to fly
Easy for you to take me to a star
Heaven is that moment when I look into your eyes

I KNOW WHY (AND SO DO YOU)
Why do robins sing in December, long before the Springtime is due?
And, even though it's snowing, violets are growing, I know why, and so do you

Why do breezes sigh every evening, whispering your name, as they do?
And, why have I the feeling, stars are on my ceiling, I know why, and so do you
	When you smile at me, I hear gypsy violins
	When you dance with me, I'm in heaven when the music begins
I can see the sun when it's raining, hiding every cloud from my view
And, why do I see rainbows when you're in my arms? I know why, and so do you

Why do robins sing in December, long before the Springtime is due?
And, even though it's snowing, violets are growing, I know why, and so do you
I know why, and so do you

I LEFT MY HEART IN SAN FRANCISCO
	The loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly gay. The glory that was Rome is of another day.
	I've been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan. I'm going home to my city by the Bay
I left my heart in San Francisco. High on a hill, it calls to me
To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care

My love waits there in San Francisco, above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you, San Francisco, your golden sun will shine for me

I LIKE IT, I LOVE IT
Spent forty-eight dollars last night at the county fair
I throwed out my shoulder, but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me sayin' sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep, my long-lost buddies say I'm gettin' in too deep
	But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it, I try so hard, I can't rise above it
	Don't know what it  is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
	But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
My mama and daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holding umbrellas, and openin' up doors
I'm takin' out the trash, and I'm sweepin' my floors
Crossin' my fingers, and countin' every kiss, prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this
	But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it, I try so hard, I can't rise above it
	Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
	But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
Got to wash my truck and dress up, to pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa
She'll move a little closer, she can't get enough of me
	And I like it, I love it, I want some more of it, I try so hard, I can't rise above it
	Don't know what it  is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
	But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it        (repeat last two lines)

I LIKE IT LIKE THAT
Come on (come on, let me show you where it's at)
Ah, come on (come on, let me show you where it's at)
Whoa!, come on (come on, let me show you where it's at)
I said the name of the place is I like it like that

Come on (come on, let me show you where it's at)
Ah, come on (come on, let me show you where it's at)
I wanna show you (come on, let me show you where it's at)
The name of the place is I like it like that
	They got a little place a-down the track
	The name of the place is I like it like that
	You take Sally and I'll take Sue
	And we're gonna rock away all our blues
Come on (come on, let me show you where it's at)
Oh, come on (come on, let me show you where it's at)
Ah, come on (come on, let me show you where it's at)
The name of the place is I like it like that
	The last time I was down there, they lost my shoes
	They had some cat shoutin' the blues
	The people was yellin' and shoutin' for more
	And all they kept sayin' was-a "go man, go"
Come on (come on let me show you where it's at)
Ah, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)
I wanna show you (come on let me show you where it's at)
I said the name of the place is I like it like that

I'LL BE AROUND
I'll be around, no matter how you treat me now. I'll be around from now on
Your latest love can never last, and when it's past, I'll be around when he's gone
	Good-bye again, and, if you find a love like mine
	Just now and then, oh, drop a line to say you're feeling fine
And when things go wrong, perhaps you'll see you're meant for me
So, I'll be around, I'll be around, I'll be around when he's gone

I'LL BE BACK
You know, if you break my heart I'll go, but I'll be back again
Cause I, told you once before good-bye, but I came back again
	I love you so, I'm the one who wants you, yes, I'm the one who wants you, Oh  oh  oh  oh
Oh you, could find better things to do  than to break my heart again
This time, I will try to show that I'm not trying to pretend
	  I thought that you would realize, that if I ran away from you
	You would want me too, but I got a big surprise, Oh oh oh oh
Oh you, could find better things to do  than to break my heart again
This time, I will try to show that I'm not trying to pretend
	I wanna go, but I hate to leave you, you know I hate to leave you, Oh  oh  oh  oh
You, if you break my heart I'll go, but I'll be back again.

I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS
	I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love, even more than I usually do
	And, although I know it's a long road back, I promise you
I'll be home for Christmas, you can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe and presents on the tree.
Christmas Eve will find me where the lovelight gleams.
I'll be home for Christmas, if only  in    my dreams, if only in my dreams.

I'LL BE SEEING YOU
I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day thru.
In that small café; the park across the way,
The children's carousel, the chestnut trees, the wishing well.

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay, I'll always think of you that way.
I'll find you in the morning sun and when the night is new.
I'll be looking at the moon, but I'll be seeing you.

I'LL BE YOUR BABY TONIGHT
Close your eyes, close the door, you don't have to worry any more
     I'll be your baby tonight.
Shut the light, shut the shade, you don't have to be afraid
     I'll be your baby tonight.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away, we're gonna forget it
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
But we're gonna let it, you won't regret it.

Kick your shoes off, do not fear, bring that bottle over here
     I'll be your baby tonight. Yes, I'll be your baby tonight.

I'LL BUILD A STAIRWAY TO PARADISE
All you preachers who delight in panning the dancing teachers
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through the gates of Heaven
It's madness to be always sitting around in sadness
When you could be learning the steps of gladness
You'll be happy when you can do just six or seven                                
Begin today, you'll find it's nice, the quickest way to paradise
When you practice, here's the thing to do, simply say as you go...
	I'll build a stairway to paradise, with a new step every day
	I'm going to get there at any price. Stand aside, I'm on my way
	I've got the blues and up above it's so fair, shoes, go on and carry me there
	I'll build a stairway to paradise, with a new step every day, with a new step every day

I'LL CRY INSTEAD
I've got every reason on earth to be mad, 'cause I've just lost the only girl I had.
If I could get my way, I'd get myself locked up today,
But I can't so I cry instead.
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet, I can't talk to people that I meet.
If I could see you now, I'd try to make you sad somehow,
But I can't so I cry instead.
	Don't want to cry when there's people there, I get shy when they start to stare,
	I'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay; but I'll come back again someday.
And when I do you'd better hide all the girls, I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world.
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two, and show you what your loving man can do,
Until then I'll cry instead.

I'LL FLY AWAY
Some bright morning when this life is over, I'll fly away
To that home on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away
	I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away in the morning
	When I die, hallelujah, by and by, I'll fly away
When the shadows of this life have gone, I'll fly away
Like a bird from these prison walls I'll fly, I'll fly away
	I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away in the morning
	When I die, hallelujah, by and by, I'll fly away
Just a few more weary days and then, I'll fly away
To a land where joys will never end, I'll fly away
	I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away in the morning
	When I die, hallelujah, by and by, I'll fly away

I'LL FOLLOW THE SUN
 One day you'll look to see I've gone, for tomorrow may rain so, I'll follow the sun
Some day you'll know I was the one, but tomorrow may rain so, I'll follow the sun
	And now the time has come, and so my love I must go
	And though I lose a friend in the end you will know, oh oh oh
One day you'll find that I have gone, but tomorrow may rain so, I'll follow the sun
Yet, tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.
	And now the time has come, and so my love I must go
	And though I lose a friend in the end you will know, oh oh oh
One day you'll find that I have gone, but tomorrow may rain so, I'll follow the sun

I'LL GET BY
I'll get by as long as I have you
Though there be rain and darkness, too, I'll not complain, I'll see it through
Poverty may come to me it's true
But what care I, say, I'll get by, as long as I have you
But what care I, say, I'll get by, as long as I have you

I'LL HAVE TO SAY I LOVE YOU IN A SONG
Well, I know it's kind of late,  I hope I didn't wake you,
But what I got to say can't wait, I know you'd understand
   Every time I tried to tell you the words just came out wrong, so I'll have to say I love you in a song.
Yeah, I know it's kind of strange, but every time I'm near you,
I just run out of things to say,  I know you'd understand
   Every time I tried to tell you the words just came out wrong, so I'll have to say I love you in a song.
Well, I know it's kind of late, I hope I didn't wake you,
But there's something that I just gotta say, I know you'd under-stand
   Every time I tried to tell you the words just came out wrong, so I'll have to say I love you in a song.

I'LL KNOW
     There, she'll (he'll) stand before my eyes one day; I won't need a second glance her (his) way
I'll know, when my love comes along, I'll know, then and there
I'll know, at the sight of her (his) face, how I care, how I care, how I care
And I'll stop, and I'll stare,

And I'll know, long before we can speak, I'll know, in my heart
I'll know, and I won't ever ask, "Am I right, am I wise, am I smart?"
But I'll stop, and I'll stare at that face in the throng
Yes, I'll know, when my love comes along

"Am I right, am I wise, am I smart?"
But I'll stop, and I'll stare at that face in the throng
Yes, I'll know, when my love comes along

I'LL NEVER FALL IN LOVE AGAIN
What do you get when you fall in love? A girl with a pin to burst your bubble
That's what you get for all your trouble
I'll never fall in love again, I'll never fall in love a-gain
What do you get when you kiss a girl? You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do, she'll never phone ya
I'll never fall in love again. Don't ya know that I'll never fall in love again?
	Don't tell me what it's all about, 'cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
	Out of those chains, those chains that bind you. That is why I'm here to remind you
What do you get when you fall in love? You only get lies and pain and sorrow
So, for at least until tomorrow, I'll never fall in love again
Don't ya know that I'll never fall in love again? I'll never fall in love again.

I'LL NEVER FIND ANOTHER YOU
There's a new world somewhere, they call the Promised Land
And I'll be there someday, if you will hold my hand
I still need you there beside me, no matter what I do
For I know I'll never find another you

There is always someone for each of us, they say
And you'll be my someone, forever and a day
I could search the whole world over, until my life is through
But I know I'll never find another you
	It's a long, long journey, so stay by my side
	When I walk through the storm, you'll be my guide, be my guide
If they gave me a fortune, my treasure would be small
I could lose it all tomorrow, and never mind at all
But if I should lose your love, dear, I don't know what I'll do
For I know I'll never find another you
But if I should lose your love, dear, I don't know what I'll do
For I know I'll never find another you, another you, another you

I'LL NEVER FORGET THE DAY I READ A BOOK
	When I look back through my life I find lots of memories remain
	Certain days stay in my mind, and keep runnin' through my brain
	I remember the day that Eddly swam the channel, what a plot!
	I remember the Wall Street crash, and when Winchell first shouted flash!
	But there's one day that I recall, though it was years ago
	All my life I will remember it, I know!
I'll never forget the day I read a book. It was contagious, seventy pages.
There were pictures here and there, so it wasn't hard to bear,
The day I read a book.
It's a shame I don't recall the name of the book. It wasn't a history. I know because it had no plot.
It wasn't a mystery, because nobody there got shot.
The day I read a book ? I can't remember when, but one o' these days, I'm gonna do it again.

I'LL NEVER SMILE AGAIN
I'll never smile again, until I smile at you. I'll never  laugh again, what good would it do?
For tears would fill my eyes, my heart would realize that our  romance is through

I'll never love again, I'm so in love with you. I'll never thrill again to somebody new
Within my heart, I know I will never start to smile again, until I smile at you
Within my heart, I know I will never start to smile again, until I smile at you

I'LL REMEMBER APRIL
This lovely day will lengthen into evening, we'll sigh goodbye to all we've ever had
Alone, where we have walked together, I'll remember April and be glad
I'll be content you loved me once in April, your lips were warm and love and Spring were new
But I'm not afraid of Autumn and her sorrow, for I'll remember April, April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes, for flames and love live such a little while
I won't forget, but I won't be lonely, I'll remember April, and I'll smile.

I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS
I'll see you in my dreams, hold you in my dreams.
Someone took you out of my arms, still I feel the thrill of your charms.
Lips that once were mine, tender eyes that shine,
They will light my way tonight, I'll see you in my dreams.

I'LL  TAKE ROMANCE
I'll take romance, while my heart is young and eager to fly
I'll give my heart a try, I'll take romance
I'll take romance, while my arms are strong and eager for you
I'll give my arms their cue, I'll take romance
	So, my lover, when you want me, call me, in the hush of the evening
	When you call me, in the hush of the evening, I'll rush to my first real romance
	While my heart is young and eager and gay, I'll give my heart away,
	I'll take romance,  I'll take romance

I'LL WALK ALONE
I'll walk alone, because to tell you the truth I'll be lonely,
I don't mind being lonely, when my heart tells me you are lonely too.

I'll walk alone, they'll ask me why and I'll tell them I'd rather.
There are dreams I must gather, dreams we fashioned the night you held me tight.
	I'll always be near you wherever you are each night in every prayer.
	If you call, I'll hear you, no matter how far, just close your eyes and I'll be there.
Please walk alone and send your love and your kisses to guide me
Till you're walking beside me, I'll walk alone.
Till you're walking beside me, I'll walk alone.

I LOVE A PIANO
As a child, I went wild when a band played. How I ran to the man when his hand swayed
Clarinets were my pets, and a slide trombone I thought was simply divine
But today when they play, I could hiss them, every bar is a jar to my system
But there's one musical instrument that I call mine....

I love a piano, I love a piano. I love to hear somebody play
Upon a piano, a grand piano, it simply carries me away
	I know a fine way to treat a Steinway, I love to run my fingers o'er the keys, the ivories
And with the pedal, I love to meddle. Not only music from Broadway,
I'm so delighted if I'm invited to hear a long-haired genius play
	So you can keep your fiddle and your bow, give me a p-i-a-n-o oh, oh
	I love to stop right beside an upright or a high toned baby grand

I LOVE A RAINY NIGHT
Well, I love a rainy night, I love a rainy night,
I love to hear the thunder, watch the lightning when it lights up the sky
You know it makes me feel good
Well, I love a rainy night, it's such a beautiful sight
I love to feel the rain on my face,  taste the rain on my lips, in the moonlight shadow
	Showers wash all my cares away, I wake up to a sunny day
'Cause I love a rainy night, yeah, I love a rainy night
Well I love a rainy night, well, I love a rainy night,  ooh  ooh
Well, I love a rainy night, I love a rainy night,
I love to hear the thunder, watch the lightning when it lights up the sky
You know it makes me feel good
Well, I love a rainy night, it's such a beautiful sight
I love to feel the rain on my face,  taste the rain on my lips, in the moonlight shadow
	Puts a song in this heart of mine, puts a smile on my face every time
'Cause I love a rainy night, yeah, I love a rainy night
Ooh,  I love a rainy night, yeah, I love a rainy night,  ooh  ooh
	Showers wash all my cares away, I wake up to a sunny day
'Cause I love a rainy night, yeah, I love a rainy night
Well, I love a rainy night, I love a rainy night,  ooh  ooh
Well, I love a rainy night, you can see it in my eyes, yeah, I love a rainy night, well it makes me high
Ooh, I love a rainy night, you know I do, yeah, yeah, I love a rainy night

I LOVE BEING HERE WITH YOU
I love the East, I love the West, and North and South, they're both the best
But I only go there as a guest, 'cause I love being here with you

I love the sea, I love the shore, I love the rocks, and what is more
With you there, they'd never be a bore, 'cause I love being here with you
	Singing in the shower, laughing by the hour, life is such a breezy game
	Love all kinds of weather, long as we're together, I love to hear you say my name
I like good wine and fine cuisine, and candle light, I like the scene
But, baby, if you know what I mean, I love being here with you
	Basie's band a-swinging, I like Ella's singing, because there's something else, you know
	They know how to say it, they know how to play it, they wind it up and let it go
I love the thrill of New York shows, I'd love to kiss Durante's nose
But I'd like to say before I close, that I love being here with you

I LOVE HOW YOU LOVE ME
I love how your eyes close, whenever you kiss me
And when I'm away from you, I love how you miss me
I love the way you always treat me tenderly
But, darling, most of all, I love how you love me
　　　　I love how your heart beats, whenever I hold you
　　　　I love how you think of me, without being told to
　　　　I love the way your touch is always heavenly
　　　　But, darling, most of all, I love how you love me
I love the way your touch is always heavenly
But, darling, most of all, I love how you love me
I love how you hug me, I love how you squeeze me, tease me, please me,
Love how you love me, I love how you love me, I love how you love me,
I love how you love me, I love how you love me!

I LOVE MY BABY, MY BABY LOVES ME
I love my baby, my baby loves me. Don't know nobody as happy as we
She's only twenty and I'm twenty-one, we never worry, we're just havin' fun
Sometimes we quarrel, and maybe we fight. But then we make up, the following night
When we're together we're great company
I love my baby, my baby loves me,I love my baby, my baby loves me

I LOVE PARIS
     Every time I look down on this timeless town, whether blue or grey be her skies
     Whether loud be her cheers, or whether soft be her tears, more and more to I realize that
I love Paris in the springtime, I love Paris in the fall
I love Paris in the winter, when it drizzles, I love Paris in the summer, when it sizzles
I love Paris every moment, every moment of the year
I love Paris, why, oh why do I love Paris? Because my love is there

I LOVE THE FLOWER GIRL
I saw her sitting in the rain, raindrops falling on her
She didn't seem to care, she sat there and smiled at me
     Then I knew she could make me happy, flowers in her hair, flowers everywhere
	I love the flower girl, oh, I don't know just why, she simply caught my eye
	I love the flower girl, she seemed so sweet and kind, she crept into my mind
I knew I had to say hello, she smiled up at me
And she took my hand, and we walked through the park alone
     And I knew she had made me happy, flowers in her hair, flowers everywhere
	I love the flower girl, oh, I don't know just why, she simply caught my eye
	I love the flower girl, she seemed so sweet and kind, she crept into my mind
Suddenly, the sun broke through, I turned around, he was gone
All  I had left was one little flower in my hand
     But I knew she had made me happy, flowers in her hair, flowers everywhere
	I love the flower girl, was she reality, or just a dream to me?
	I love the flower girl, her love showed me the way to find a sunny day

I LOVE YOU TRULY
I love you truly, truly dear
Life with its sorrow, life with its tear
Fades into dreams when I feel you are near
For I love you truly, truly dear

Ah, love, 'tis something to feel your kind hand
Ah yes, 'tis something by your side to stand
Gone is the sorrow, gone doubt and fear
For you love me truly, truly dear
	Fades into dreams when I feel you are near
	For I love you truly, truly dear

I'M A BELIEVER
I thought love was only true in fairy tales, meant for someone else, but not for me.
Love was out to get me, do, do, do, do, that's the way it seems, do, do, do ,do, do
Disappointment haunted all my dreams.
	Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
	Not a trace of doubt in my mind
	I'm in love, oooo, I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried.
I thought love was more or less a giving thing; seems the more I gave the less I got.
What's the use in tryin', do, do, do, do, do, all you get is pain, do, do, do, do, do.
When I needed sunshine I got rain.
	Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
	Not a trace of doubt in my mind
	I'm in love, oooo, I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried.
	(Repeat last 3 lines)

I'M A DRIFTER
	I'm a drifter, I'm a loner, well I've seen every village and town
	I've passed by here, and I'll die here, and some stranger will lower me down
I've envied the ships that sail out of your harbors,
Shared silent thoughts with your children and barbers
And sung to the stars while the jukebox was playin'
Fought back the tears that come when I'm sayin'....
	 CHORUS
I've made love in your city to the poor and the pretty
Thought myself lucky and smart
And ended up lonely, with nothin' but only a song and a half of a heart
	CHORUS

I'M A FOOL TO CARE
I'm a fool to care, when you treat me this way
I know I love you, but what can I do? I'm a fool to care
I'm a fool to cry, when you tell me good-bye
You left me so blue, when you were untrue, I'm a fool to care
	I know I should laugh and call it a day, but I know I would cry if you went away
I'm a fool to care, when you don't care for me
So why should I pretend? I'll lose in the end, I'm a fool to care
	I know I should laugh and call it a day, but I know I would cry if you went away
I'm a fool to care, when you don't care for me
So why should I pretend? I'll lose in the end, I'm a fool to care

I'M A LOSER
	I'm a loser, I'm a loser,  and I'm not what I appear to be.
Of all the love I have won or have lost, there is one love I should never have crossed.
She was a girl in a million my friend, I should have known she would win in the end.
	I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me
	I'm a loser,  and I'm not what I appear to be.
Although I laugh and I act like a clown, beneath this mask I am wearing a frown.
My tears are falling like rain from the sky, ss it for her or myself that I cry

What have I done to deserve such a fate? I realize I have left it too late.
And so it's true pride comes before a fall, I'm telling you so that you don't lose all.
	CHORUS

I'M ALWAYS CHASING RAINBOWS
I'm always chasing rainbows, watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams, ending in the sky
	Some fellows look and find the sunshine, I always look and find the rain
	Some fellows make a winning sometimes. I never even make a gain, believe me
I'm always chasing rainbows, waiting to find a little bluebird, in vain.

I'M AN OLD COWHAND
I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande, but my legs ain't bowed and my cheeks ain't tan
	I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow, never roped a steer, 'cause I don't know how
	Sure ain't a-fixin to start in now, yippie yi yo kayay
I'm an old cowhand and I come down from the Rio Grande
And I learned to ride, ride, ride 'fore I learned to stand
	I'm a ridin' fool who is up to date,  I know every trail in the Lone Star State
	'Cause I ride the range in a Ford V-8, yippie yi yo kayay, hey, yippie yi yo kayay
We're old cowhands from the Rio Grande, and we come to town just to hear the band
	We know all the songs that the cowboys know, 'bout the big corral where the doggies go
	We learned them all on the radio, yippie yi yo kayah

BUTTONS AND BOWS
East is east and west is west, and the wrong one I have chose
Let's go where you'll keep on wearin' those frills and flowers and buttons and bows,
Rings and things and buttons and bows

Don't bury me on the lone prairie, take me where the cement grows
Let's move down to some big town, where they love a gal by the cut of her clothes
And you'll stand out in buttons and bows
	I'll love you in buckskins or skirts that you've homespun
	But I'll love ya' longer, stronger, where your friends don't tote a gun
My bones denounce the buckboard bounce, and the cactus hurts my toes
Let's vamoose where the gals keep usin' those silks and satins and linen that shows
And you're all mine in buttons and bows

Gimme Eastern trimmin' where women are women, in high silk hose and peek-a-boo clothes
With French perfume that rocks the room, and you're all mine in buttons and bows.

I'M BEGINNING TO SEE THE LIGHT
I never cared much for moonlit skies, I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes, I'm beginning to see the light
I never went in for afterglow, or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low, I'm beginning to see the light
	Used to ramble through the park, shadow boxing in the dark
	Then you came and caused a spark that's a four-alarm fire now
I never made love by lantern shine, I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lipes burning mine, I'm beginning to see the light.

I'M CONFESSIN' THAT I LOVE YOU
I'm confessin' that I love you, tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I love you, honest I do, need you every moment
In your eyes I read such strange things, but your lips deny they're true
Will your answer really change things, making me blue?
	I'm afraid some day you'll leave me, saying, "Can't we still be friends?"
	If you go you know you'll grieve me; all in life on you depends.
Am I guessin' that you love me, dreaming dreams of you in vain,
I'm confessin' that I love you over again.

I'M EASY
It's not my way to love you just 'cause no one's lookin'
It's not my way to take your hand if I'm not sure
It's not my way to let you see what's goin' on inside of me
When it's a love you won't be needing, you're not free

Please stop pullin' at my sleeve if you're just playin'
If you won't take the things you make me want to give
I never cared too much for games, and this one's drivin' me in-sane
You're not half as free to wander as you claim
	But I'm easy, yeah, I'm easy,  give the word, I'll play your games
	As though that's how it ought to be, because I'm easy
Don't lead me on if there's no-where for you to take me
If lovin' you will have to be a sometime thing
I can't put bars on my in-sides, my love is somethin' I can't hide
It still hurts when I recall the times I've cried
	Because I'm easy, yeah, I'm easy, take my hands and pull me down
	I won't put up any fight, because I'm easy
Don't do me favors let me watch you from a distance
'Cause when you're near I find it hard to keep my head
And when your eyes throw light at mine, it's e-nough to change my mind
Make me leave my cautious words and ways be-hind
	That's why I'm easy, yeah, I'm easy, say you want me, I'll come runnin'
	Without takin' time to think  (followed by choruses 2 and 1)

I'M FREE
I'm free to do what I want any old time
I'm free to do what I want any old time
	So love me, hold me, love me, hold me
	'Cause I'm free to do what I want any old time
I'm free to sing my song, though it gets out of time
I'm free to sing my song, though it gets out of time
	So love me, hold me, love me, hold me
	'Cause I'm free any old time to get what I want

	So love me, hold me, love me, hold me
	'Cause I'm free any old time to get what I want
I'm free to choose what I please any old time.
I'm free to please what I choose any old time
	So hold me, love me, love me, hold me
	"Cause I'm free any old time to do what I want

I'M GONNA MAKE YOU LOVE ME
I'm gonna do all the things for you, a girl/man wants a man/girl to do, oh, baby
I'll sacrifice for you, I'll even do wrong for you, oh, baby
     Every minute, every hour, I'm gonna shower you with love and affection
     Look out, it's comin' in your direction
	I'm gonna make you love me, oh, yes I will, yes I will
	I'm gonna make you love me, oh, yes I will, yes I will
My love is strong, you see, I know you'll never get tired of me, oh, baby
I'm gonna use every trick in the book to try my best to get you hooked, oh, baby
     Every night, every day, I'm gonna say, "I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you,
     Look out, girl, 'cause I'm gonna get you
	I'm gonna make you love me, oh, yes I will, yes I will
	I'm gonna make you love me, oh, yes I will, yes I will
     Every night, every day, I'm gonna say, "I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you,
     Look out, girl, 'cause I'm gonna get you
	I'm gonna make you love me, oh, yes I will, yes I will
	I'm gonna make you love me, oh, yes I will, yes I will

I'M GONNA SIT RIGHT DOWN AND WRITE MYSELF A LETTER
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter, and make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words oh, so sweet, they're gonna knock me off my feet
Lots of kisses on the bottom, I'll be glad I got 'em.
I'm gonna smile and say I hope you're feeling better, and close with "Love" the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter, and make believe it came from you.

I'M HAPPY JUST TO DANCE WITH YOU
Before this dance is through I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
I don't want to kiss or hold your hand. If it's funny, try and understand
There is nothing else I'd rather do, because I'm happy just to dance with you
I don't need to hug or hold you tight. I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do, because I'm happy just to dance with you
	Just to dance with you is everything I need
	Before this dance is through I think I'll love you too, I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place, let's pretend, we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do, because I'm happy just to dance with you
	Just to dance with you is everything I need
	Before this dance is throughI think I'll love you too, I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place, let's pretend, we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do. I've discovered I'm in love with you
Oh, oh Because I'm happy just to dance with youOh, oh

I'M IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE
I'm in the mood for love, simply because you're near me
Funny, but when you're near me, I'm in the mood for love
Heaven is in your eyes, bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder, I'm in the mood for love.
	Why stop to think of whether this little dream might fade?
	We've put our hearts together, now we are one, I'm not afraid!
If there's a cloud above, if it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it! I'm in the mood for love

I'M INTO SOMETHING GOOD
Woke up this morning feeling fine, there's something special on my mind
Last night I met a new girl in the neighborhood, whoa yeah
Something tells me I'm into something good (Something tells me I'm into something)
She's the kind of girl who's not too shy, and I can tell I'm her kind of guy
She danced close to me like I hoped she would  (she danced with me like I hoped she would)
Something tells me I'm into something good (Something tells me I'm into something)
      We only danced for a minute or two, but then she stuck to me the whole night through
      Can I be falling in love?
      She's everything I've been dreaming of.  She's everything I've been dreaming of
I walked her home and she held my hand, I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could  (I asked to see her and she told me I could)
Something tells me I'm into something good  (Something tells me I'm into something)
Something tells me I'm into something good  (Something tells me I'm into something,)
Something tells me I'm into something good  (Something tells me I'm into something,) good!

I'M JUST A LUCKY SO AND SO
As I walk down the street, seems everyone I meet, gives me a friendly hello
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

The birds in every tree are all so neighborly, they sing wherever  I go
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so
     If you should ask me the amount in my bank account, I'd have to admit that I'm slippin'
     But that don't worry me, confidentially, I've got a dream that's a pippin
And when the day is through, each night I hurry to a home where love waits, I know
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

I'M JUST WILD ABOUT HARRY
I`m just wild about Harry, and Harry's wild about me
The heavenly blisses of his kisses fill me with ecstasy.
He's sweet just like chocolate candy, and just like honey from a bee
Oh, I`m just wild about Harry, and he's just wild about me

I`m just wild about Harry, and Harry's wild about me
The heavenly blisses of his kisses fill me with ecstasy.
He's sweet just like chocolate candy, and just like honey from a bee
Oh, I`m just wild about Harry, and he's just wild about,
He can't do without, Harry's wild about me
Yes, he's just wild about, he can't do without, Harry's wild about me

I'M LEAVING IT ALL UP TO YOU
I'm leavin' it all up to you, you decide what you're gonna do
Now, do you want my love, or are we through?

That's why I'm leavin' it all up to you, you decide what you're gonna do
Now, do you want my love, or are we through?
	I've got my heart in my hand, I don't understand
	What have I done wrong?  You know I worship the ground you walk on
That's why I'm leavin' it all up to you, you decide what you're gonna do
Now, do you want my love, or are we through? Or are we through? Or are we through?

I'M LOOKING OVER A FOUR-LEAF CLOVER
I'm looking over a four-leaf clover that I overlooked before
One leaf is sunshine, the second is rain,  third is the roses that grow in the lane
You know there's no need explaining the one remaining is someone that I adore.
I'm looking over a four-leaf clover that I overlooked before.

I'M OLD FASHIONED
I'm old fashioned, I love the moonlight, I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain upon a window pane, the starry song that April sings
	This year's fancies are passing fancies,
	But sighing sighs, holding hands, these my heart understands
I'm old fashioned, but I don't mind it, that's how I want to be,
As long as you agree to stay old fashioned with me.

I'M SITTING ON TOP OF THE WORLD
I'm sitting on top of the world, just rolling along, just rolling along.
I'm quitting the blues of the world, just singing a song, just singing a song
Glory Hallelujah, I just phoned the Parson, hey, Par, get ready to call
Just like Humpty Dumpty, I'm going to fall
I'm sitting on top of the world, just rolling along, just rolling along.

I'M SO LONESOME I COULD CRY
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill,  he sounds too blue to fly.
The midnight train is whining low, I'm so lonesome I could cry.
	I've never seen a night so long when time goes crawling by.
	The moon just went behind a cloud to hide its face and cry.
Did you ever see a robin weep, when leaves began to die?
That means he's lost the will to live, I'm so lonesome I could cry.
	The silence of a falling star lights up a purple sky.
	And as I wonder where you are, I'm so lonesome I could cry.

I'M SORRY (Brenda Lee)
I'm sorry, so sorry, that I was such a fool. I didn't know, love could be so cruel
	Oh, oh, oh, oh, uh-oh, oh, yes
You tell me, "mistakes are part of being young."
But that don't right the wrong that's been done
I'm sorry, so sorry, please accept my apology. But love is blind and I was to blind to see
	Oh, oh, oh, oh, uh-oh, oh, yes
You tell me, "mistakes are part of being young."
But that don't right the wrong that's been done
	Oh, oh, oh, oh, uh-oh, oh, yes
I'm sorry, so sorry, please accept my apology. But love is blind and I was to blind to see

I'M SORRY  (John Denver)
It's cold here in the city, it always seems that way,
And I've been thinking about you almost every day.
Thinking about the good times, thinking about the rain.
Thinking about how bad it feels alone again.
	I'm sorry for the way things are in China, I'm sorry things ain't what they used to be.
	More than anything else, I'm sorry for myself cause you're not here with me.
Our friends all ask about you, I say you're doing fine.
I expect to hear from you almost anytime.
They all know I'm crying, and I can't sleep at night.
They all know I'm dying down deep inside.
	I'm sorry for all the lies I told you, I'm sorry for the things I didn't say.
	But more than anything else, I'm sorry for myself. I can't believe you went away.
	I'm sorry if I took some things for granted, I'm sorry for the chains I put on you.
	But more than anything else, I'm sorry for myself for living without you.

I'M TELLING YOU NOW
I'm telling you now, I'm telling you right away,
I'll be staying for many a day, I'm in love with you now.
I'm telling you now, I'll say what you want to hear,
I'll be telling you for many a year, I'm in love with you now.
    Do you think I'm fooling when I say, I love you, I  love you!
    Maybe you'll believe me when I'm finally through, through, through  through!
I'm telling you now, I know it's been said before,
Say you love me and I will be sure, I'm in love with you now.

I'M WALKIN'
I'm walkin', yes indeed, and I'm talkin' 'bout you and me, I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me
I'm lonely as I can be, I'm waitin' for your company, I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me
	What 'ya gonna do when the well runs dry? You're gonna run away and hide
	I'm gonna run right by your side, for you pretty baby I'd even die
I'm walkin', yes indeed, I'm talkin' 'bout you and me, I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me
	What 'ya gonna do when the well runs dry? You're gonna run away and hide
	I'm gonna run right by your side, for you pretty baby I'd even die
I'm walkin', yes indeed, and I'm talkin' 'bout you and me, I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me
I'm lonely as I can be, I'm waitin' for your company, I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me
	What 'ya gonna do when the well runs dry? You're gonna sit right down and cry
	What 'ya gonna do when I say bye-bye? All you're gonna do is dry you eye
I'm walkin', yes indeed, I'm talkin' 'bout you and me, I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me

I NEED YOU
You don't realize how much I need you. Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me, I'm lonely as can be, I need you

Said you had a thing or two to tell me. How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes. You told me.
	Oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
	That's when it hurt me, and feeling like this, I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you. I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you
	But when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
	That's when it hurt me, and feeling like this, I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you. I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me.
I need you, I need you, I need you

I NEVER DREAMED YOU'D LEAVE IN SUMMER
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer. I thought you would go, then come back home
I thought the cold would leave by summer, but my quiet nights will be spent a-lone

You said there would be warm love in springtime. That is when you started to be cold
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer, but now I find my-self all a-lone

You said then you'd be the life in autumn. Said you'd be the one to see the way
No, I never dreamed you'd leave in summer, but now I find my love has gone a-way
Why didn't you stay?

I NEVER SEE MAGGIE ALONE
　　　　Maggie Dear just won't go out alone. It seems that she must have a chaperone.
　　　　When we go out, no matter where we're bound, there's always somebody around.
She brings her father, her mother, her sister and her brother, I never see Maggie alone.
She brings her uncles, her cousins, she's got 'em by the dozens, oh, I never see Maggie alone.
And if I phone her, say to her sweet.  "Where shall we meet? Supposin' that we eat,"
She brings her father, her mother, her sister and her brother, oh, I never See Maggie alone.
　　　　
I bought a roadster, two seated - I even had it heated so that I could see Maggie alone.
While we were ridin' and kissin', the engine started missin,' we were a long way from home.
I got right out then, fast as I could; I found what was wrong, for when I raised the hood:
There was her father, her mother, her sister and her brother, oh, I never see Maggie alone.
　　　　
One day she said she was wishin' that I would take her fishin,' I knew I'd see Maggie alone!
In a canoe then, we two then went glidin' o'er the water, far from the noise of her home.
I threw my line in - thought I'd catch a trout, I got a bite, pulled the line right out.
There was her father, her mother, her sister and her brother, oh, I never See Maggie alone.
　　　　
One night while we were out walkin', and she grew tired of talkin', she invited me up to her home
I turned the lights down, they were too bright, oh what a night, but when I turned on the light
There was her father, her mother, her sister and her brother, oh, I never see Maggie,
I'd love to see Maggie, oh, I never see Maggie a-lone!

I NEVER WILL MARRY
Some say that love is a gentle thing, but it's only brought me pain
For the only girl/man that I ever did love has gone on the morning train
	I never will marry, I'll take me no wife/I'll be no man's wife
	I expect to live single all the days of my life
The train pulled out, and the whistle blew, with a loud, and lonesome moan
She's/He's gone, she's/he's gone, like the morning dew, and left me here all alone
	I never will marry, I'll take me no wife/I'll be no man's wife
	I expect to live single all the days of my life
There's many a change in the winter wind, and a change in the cloud's design
There's many a change in a young girl's/man's heart, but never a change in mine
	I never will marry, I'll take me no wife/I'll be no man's wife
	I expect to live single all the days of my life

I ONLY HAVE EYES FOR YOU
	My love must be a kind of blind love. I can't see anyone but you
Are the stars out tonight? I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear
The moon may be high, but I can't see a thing in the sky, 'cause I only have eyes for you.
	I don't know if we're in a garden, or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I, maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view, and I only have eyes for you

I ONLY WANT TO BE WITH YOU
I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never want to let you go
'Cause you've started something, oh, cant you see that ever since we met you've had a hold on me
It happens to be true, I only want to be with you

It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I want to spend each moment of the day with you
Oh, look what has happened with just one kiss. I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but its true, I only want to be with you

You stopped and smiled at me, and asked if I'd care to dance
I fell into your open arms and I didn't stand a chance
Now listen,  honey, I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together, honey, I don't care
'Cause you've started something, oh, cant you see that ever since we met you've had a hold on me
No matter what you do, I only want to be with you.

I REMEMBER YOU
I remember you, you're the one who made my dreams come true, a few kisses ago
I remember you, you're the one who said, "I love you too. I do. Didn't you know?"
	I remember, too, a distant bell, and stars that fell like rain, out of the blue.
When my life is through, and the angels ask me to recall the thrill of them all.
Then I shall tell them I remember, tell them I remember, tell them I remember you.

I SAW HER STANDING THERE
Well she was just seventeen, you know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another....oooo, when I saw her standing there

Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another....oooo, when I saw her standing there
	Well my heart went boom when I crossed that room
	And I held her hand in mi.........ine
Whoa we danced through the night and we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another.....oooo since I saw her standing there (X2)

I SAW MOMMY KISSING SANTA CLAUS
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus, underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep down the stairs to have a peek,
She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep.
Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus, underneath his beard so snowy white;
Oh, what a laugh it would have been, if Daddy had only seen Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night.

I SAY A LITTLE PRAYER
The moment I wake up, before I put on my makeup, I say a little prayer for you
While combing my hair now, and wondering what dress to wear now,
I say a little prayer for you
	Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart, and I will love you
	Forever, and ever, we never will part, oh, how I'll love you
	Together, together, that's how it must be to live without you
	Would only mean heartbreak for me.
I run for the bus, dear, while riding, I think of us, dear. I say a little prayer for you
At work I just take time, and all through my coffee-break time
I say a little prayer for you
	Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart, and I will love you
	Forever, and ever, we never will part, oh, how I'll love you
	Together, together, that's how it must be to live without you
	Would only mean heartbreak for me.
My darling, believe me, for me there is no one, but you, please love me too
I'm still in love with you, answer my prayer, say you love me too...
Why don't you answer my prayer? You know, every day I say a little prayer

I SECOND THAT EMOTION
Maybe you wanna give me kisses sweet, but only for one night, and no repeat
And maybe you'll go away and never call, a taste of honey is worse than none at all
	Oh, in that case I don't want no part, I do  believe that that would only break my heart
	Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me, and you got the notion, I second that emotion
	Said, if you feel like givin' me a lifetime of devotion, I second that emotion
Maybe you think that love would tie you down, and you don't have the time to hang around
Or maybe you think that love was made for fools, and so it makes you wise to break the rules
	Oh, in that case I don't want no part, I do believe that that would only break my heart
	Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me, and you got the notion, I second that emotion
	Said, if you feel like givin' me a lifetime of devotion, I second that emotion

I SEE THE LIGHT
All those days watching from the windows, all those years outside looking in
All that time never even knowing just how blind I've been
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight, now I'm here suddenly I see
Standing here it's all so clear, I'm where I'm meant to be
And at last I see the light, and it's like the fog has lifted
And at last I see the light, and it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright, and the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything looks different, now that I see you

I SHOULD CARE
I should care, I should go around weeping. I should care, I should go without sleeping
Strangely enough, I sleep well, 'cept for a dream or two
But then I count my sheep well. Funny how sheep can lull you to sleep

So, I should care, I should let it upset me. I should care, but it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you, but I should care, and I do

I should care but it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you, but I should care, and I do, and I do

I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER
I should have known better with a girl like you that I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey hey hey, and I do!
Whoa, whoa, I never realized what I kiss could be. This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?
	That when I tell you that I love you, oh, you're gonna say you love me too, oh
	And when I ask you to be mine....you're gonna say you love me too
So I should've realized a lot of things before. If this is love you gotta give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more
Whoa, whoa, I never realized what I kiss could be, this could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?
	That when I tell you that I love you, oh, you're gonna say you love me too, oh
	And when I ask you to be mine, you're gonna say you love me too
You love me too, you love me too, you love me too

I TALK TO THE TREES
I talk to the trees, but they don't listen to me
I talk to the stars, but they never hear me
The breeze hasn't time to stop, and hear what I say
I talk to them all in vain
	But suddenly my words reach someone else's ear
	At someone else's heart strings too
I tell you my dreams, and while you're listening to me
I suddenly see them come true
     I can see us on an April night, looking out across a rolling farm
     Having supper in the candlelight, walking later, arm in arm
     Then I'll tell you how I pass the day, thinking mainly how the night would be
     Then I'll try to find the words to say all the things you mean to me
I tell you my dreams, and while you're listening to me
I suddenly see them come true

I THINK I LOVE YOU
I was sleeping, and right in the middle of a good dream
Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane, I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed, screaming out the words I dread
	I think I love you (I think I love you)
This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with, and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself, and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it, when you walked into the room
	I think I love you (I think I love you)
     I think I love you, so what am I so afraid of
     I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for
     I think I love you, isn't that what life is made of?
     Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way
	I don't know what I'm up against. I don't know what it's all about
	I got so much to think about
     Hey, I think I love you, so what am I so afraid of
     I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for
     I think I love you, isn't that what life is made of?
     Though it worries me to say, I never felt this way
Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy, and if you say "hey go away" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case, let me ask you to your face, "Do you think you love me?"
	I think I love you, I think I love you

I THINK WE'RE ALONE NOW
Children behave, that's what they say when we're together
And watch how you play. They don't understand
     And so we're running just as fast as we can, holding on to one another hands
     Trying to get away into the night and then you put your arms around me
     And we tumble to the ground and then you say
	I think we're alone now, there doesn't seem to be anyone around
	I think we're alone now, the beating of our hearts is the only sound
Look at the way we gotta hide what we're doin'
'Cause what would they say, if they ever knew
     And so we're running just as fast as we can, holding on to one another hands
     Trying to get away into the night and then you put your arms around me
     And we tumble to the ground and then you say
	I think we're alone now, there doesn't seem to be anyone around
	I think we're alone now, the beating of our hearts is the only sound

I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
Seems that I read, or somebody said, "Out of sight is out of mind."
Maybe that's so, but I tried to go and leave you behind, what did I find?

I took a trip on a train, and I thought about you.
I passed a shadowy lane, and I thought about you.
Two or three cars parked under the stars, a winding stream.
Moon shining down on some little town, and with each beam, the same old dream.
With every stop that we made, I thought about you.

And when I pulled down the shade, I really felt blue.
I peeked through the crack and looked at the track, the one going back to you.
And what did I do......What did I do......
What did I do, I thought about you.

I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE RAILROAD
I've been working on the railroad all the live-long day.
I've been working on the railroad just to pass the time away.
     Can't you hear the whistle blowing, rise up so early in the morn'
     Can't you hear the captain shouting, "Dinah, blow your horn."
	Dinah, won't you blow, Dinah, won't you blow, Dinah, won't you blow your horn?
	Dinah, won't you blow, Dinah, won't you blow, Dinah, won't you blow your horn?
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah, someone's in the kitchen I know—ow—ow—ow
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah, strummin' on the old banjo...and singin'
	Fee fie fiddle-di-i-o, fee fie fiddle-di-i-o-o-o-o
	Fee fie fiddle-di-i-o, strummin' on the old banjo.

I'VE GOT A CRUSH ON YOU
How glad the many millions of Annabelles and Lillian would be to capture me
But you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance, I fell and it was swell
I'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo, how I won you I shall never never know
It's not that you're attractive, but, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie, all the day and night-time hear me sigh
I never had the least notion, that I could fall with so much emotion
Could you coo, could you care? For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush, 'cause I have got a crush on you
Could you coo, could you care, for a cunning cottage that we could share
The world will pardon my mush, 'cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you

I'VE GOT A HOME IN THAT ROCK
I've got a home in that rock, don't you see? (X2)
Between the earth and sky, I thought I heard my Savior cry
You better get a home in that rock, don't you see?

Rich man Dives, he lived so well, don't you see? (X2)
Rich man Dives, he lived so well, when he died, he had a home in hell
He had no home in that rock, don't you see?

Poor man Lazarus, poor as I, don't you see? (X2)
Poor man Lazarus, poor as I, when he died he had a home on high
He had a home in that rock, don't you see?

God gave Noah the rainbow sign, don't you see? (X2)
God gave Noah the rainbow sign, no more water, but a fire next time.
You better get a home in that rock, don't you see?

I've got a home in that rock, don't you see? (X2)
Between the earth and sky, I thought I heard my Savior cry
You better get a home in that rock, don't you see?
You better get a home in that rock, don't you see?
You better get a home in that rock, don't you see?

I'VE GOT A LOVELY BUNCH OF COCONUTS
Down at the English fair one evening I was there
When I heard a showman shouting underneath the flair
"Oh, I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts. There they are all standing in a row.
Big ones, small ones, some as big as your head.
Give 'em a twist, a flick of the wrist," that's what the showman said.

"Oh, I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts. Every ball you throw will make me rich.
There stands me wife, the idol of me life, singing roll a bowl, a ball, a penny a pitch.
Singing, roll or bowl a ball a penny a pitch. Singing roll or bowl a ball a penny a pitch.
Roll a bowl a ball. Roll a bowl a ball. Singing, roll or bowl a ball a penny a pitch.

I'VE GOT MY LOVE TO KEEP ME WARM
The snow is snowing, the wind is blowing, but I can weather the storm!
What do I care how much it may storm? I've got my love to keep me warm.
I can't remember a worse December, just watch those icicles form!
What do I care if icicles form? I've got my love to keep me warm.
	Off with my overcoat, off with my glove, I need no overcoat, I'm burning with love!
My heart's on fire, the flame grows higher, so I will weather the storm!
What do I care how much it may storm? I've got my love to keep me warm.

I'VE GOTTA BE ME
Whether I'm right or whether I'm wrong, whether I find a place in this world or never belong
I gotta be me, I've gotta be me. What else can I be but what I am

I want to live, not merely survive, and I won't give up this dream of life that keeps me alive
I gotta be me, I gotta be me, the dream that I see makes me what I am
	That far-away prize, a world of success is waiting for me if I heed the call
	I won't settle down, won't settle for less, as long as there's a chance that I can have it all
I'll go it alone, that's how it must be. I can't be right for somebody else if I'm not right for me
I gotta be free, I've gotta be free, daring to try, to do it or die, I've gotta be me (repeat last 2 lines)

I'VE GOT THE WORLD ON A STRING
I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow,
Got the string around my finger.  What a world, what a life, I'm in love.
I've got a song that I sing, I can make the rain go
Anytime I move my finger. Lucky me, can't you see I'm in love.
Life's a beautiful thing, as long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so and so, if I should ever let it go.
I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow,
Got the string around my finger.  What a world, what a life, I'm in love.

I'VE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO HER FACE
I've grown accustomed to her face, she almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune she whistles night and noon
Her smiles, her frowns, her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now, like breathing out and breathing in
I was serenely independent, and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again, and yet
I've grown accustomed to her looks, accustomed to her voice, accustomed to her face

I've grown accustomed to her face, she almost makes the day begin
I've gotten used to hear her say, "Good morning" every day,
Her joys, her woes, her highs, her lows
Are second nature to me now, like breathing out and breathing in
I'm very grateful she's a woman, and so easy to forget
Rather like a habit one can always break, and yet
I've grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air
Accustomed to her face

I'VE HEARD THAT SONG BEFORE
It seems to me I've heard that song before.
It's from an old familiar score, I know it well, that melody
	It's funny how a theme recalls a favorite dream
	A dream that brought you so close to me
I know each word, because I've heard that song before
The lyrics said: "forevermore, forevermore's a memory
Please have them play it again, and I'll remember just when
I heard that lovely song before

I'VE JUST SEEN A FACE
I've just seen a face, I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me, and I want all the world to see
We've met, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm

Had it been another day, I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware, but as it is, I'll dream of her
Tonight, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
	Falling, yes I am falling, and she keeps calling me back again
I have never known the like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things and kept out of sight, but other girls were never quite
Like this, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
	Falling, yes I am falling, and she keeps calling me back again
I've just seen a face, I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me, and I want all the world to see
We've met, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
	Falling, yes I am falling, and she keeps calling me back again  (X3)

I'VE LOVED YOU ALL OVER THE WORLD
You're my buddy, my pal, my friend. It will  be that way until the end
And wherever you go, I want you to know, you're my buddy, my pal, my friend
I've loved all over the world.......You are my sunshine
You keep my life in a whirl........And you love me sometimes
I'll always follow my heart......Wherever it leads me
And until death do us part, I'll love you all over the world
I'll always follow my heart......Wherever it leads me
And until death do us part, I'll love you all over the world
I'll love you all over the world

I'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE BEFORE
I've never been in love before, now all at once it's you, it's you forevermore.
I've never been in love before, I thought my heart was safe, I thought I knew the score.
But this is wine that's all too strange and strong,
I'm full of foolish songs, and out my song must pour,
So please forgive this helpless haze I'm in, I've really never been in love before.

I'VE TOLD EVERY LITTLE  STAR
I've told every little star just how sweet I think you are. Why haven't I told you?
I've told ripples in a brook, made my heart an open book.  Why haven't I told you?
	Friends ask me, am I in love? I always answer, "yes."
	Might as well confess, if the answer's yes.
Maybe you may love me too, oh, my  darling, if you do, why haven't you told me?

I WALK THE LINE
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.  I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds.  Because you're mine I walk the line.
I find it very very easy to be true.  I find myself alone when day is through.
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you.  Because you're mine  I walk the line.
	Harmonica verse
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine. I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds.
Because you're mine I walk the line. Because you're mine I walk the line.

I WANNA BE AROUND
I wanna be around to pick up the pieces when somebody breaks your heart,
Somebody twice as smart as I.
Somebody who will swear to be true like you used to do with me,
Who'll leave you to learn that misery loves company, wait and see.
I wanna be around to see how he does it when he breaks your heart to bits,
Let's see if the puzzle fits, so fine,
	And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet,
	As I sit there applauding from a front row seat,
	When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine.

I WANNA BE LIKE YOU
Now, I'm  the   king of the Swingers, oh, the jungle V-I-P
I've reached the top, and had to stop, and that's what's botherin' me
I wanna be a man, mancub, and stroll right into town
And be just like the other  men, I'm tired  of  monkeyin'  a-round
        Oh,  oobee doo, I wanna be like you-hoo-hoo, I wanna walk like you, talk like you, too-oo-oo
        You'll see it's true-oo-oo, an ape like me, can learn to be hu-oo-oo-man too-hoo-hoo!
Now, don't try  to  kid me, mancub, I made a deal with you
Now,  give  me the secret,   mancub,  clue   me  what  to do.
What I desire is man's red fire, to make my dream come true.
Give me the power of man's red flower,  so I  can be like you     CHORUS

I WANT A GIRL
I want a girl just like the girl that married dear old Dad
She was a pearl and the only girl that Daddy ever had
A real old fashioned girl with heart so true,
One who loves nobody else but you.
Oh, I want a girl just like the girl that married dear old Dad

I WANT A BEER
I want a beer just like the beer that pickled dear old Dad
It was the beer, and the only beer, that Daddy ever had
	A good old fashioned beer with a head of foam
	It took ten men to carry Daddy home
Oh, I want a beer just like the beer that pickled dear old Dad

I WANT TO BE HAPPY
I want to be happy, but I won't be happy till I make you happy too
Life's really worth living, when we are mirth-giving, why can't I give some to you?
When skies are gray and you say you are blue,
 I'll send the sun smiling through
 I want to be happy, but I won't be happy till I make you happy too.

I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND
Oh, yeah, I tell you something I think you'll understand, when I say that somethin'
I want to hold your hand, I want to hold your hand, I want to hold your hand

Oh, please say to me, you'll let me be your man. And, please say to me
You'll let me hold your hand, now, let me hold your hand, I want to hold your hand
	And, when I touch you, I feel happy inside, it's such a feelin' that my love
	I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide
Yeah, you got that somethin' I think you'll understand, when I say that somethin'
I want to hold your hand, I want to hold your hand, I want to hold your hand
	And, when I touch you, I feel happy inside, it's such a feelin' that my love
	I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide
Yeah, you got that somethin' I think you'll understand, when I feel that somethin'
I want to hold your hand, I want to hold your hand, I want to hold your hand

I WANT YOU, I NEED YOU, I LOVE YOU
Hold me close, hold me tight, make me thrill with delight, let me know where I stand from the start
I want you, I need you, I love you with all my heart

Every time that you're near, all my cares disappear, darling, you're all that I'm living for
I want you, I need you, I love you, more and more
	I thought I could live without romance, before you came to me
	But now I know that I will go on loving you eternally
Won't you please be my own? Never leave me alone, 'cause I die every time we're apart
I want you, I need you, I love you, with all my heart

I WAS A LITTLE TOO LONELY
You promised me you'd come back, I promised to wait.
But I was a little too lonely, and you were a little too late.

Too many long nights alone, not even a date.
So I got a little too lonely, and you were a little too late.
	You never did write, you never did call, when I had the blues, you were havin' a ball.
	You thought that I'd be here to run to, now I'm gonna do to you what I've been done to.
Too bad about you, my friend, it could've been great.
But I was a little too lonely, and now you're a little too late.
	You never did write, you never did call, when I had the blues, you were havin' a ball.
	You thought that I'd be here to run to, now I'm gonna do to you what I've been done to.
Too bad about you, my friend, it could've been great.
But I got a little too lonely, and you were a little too late!

I WAS BORN UNDER A WANDERIN' STAR
I was born under a wandrin' star, I was born under a wandrin' star.
Wheels are made for rollin', mules are made to pack.
I've never seen a sight that didn't look better looking back.
I was born under a wandrin' star.
	Mud can make you prisoner, and the plains can bake you dry.
	Snow can burn your eyes, but only people make you cry.
	Home is made for comin' from, for dreams of goin' to,
	Which with any luck will never come true.
I was born under a wandrin' star, I was born under a wandrin' star.
Do I know where hell is? Hell is in hello.
Heaven is in goodbye for ever, it's time for me to go.
I was born under a wandrin' star, a wandrin' wandrin' star.
	Mud can make you prisoner, and the plains can bake you dry.
	Snow can burn your eyes, but only people make you cry.
	Home is made for comin' from, for dreams of goin' to,
	Which with any luck will never come true.
I was born under a wandrin' star, I was born under a wandrin' star.
When I get to heaven, tie me to a tree,
Or I'll begin to roam, and soon you know where I will be.
I was born under a wandrin' star, a wandrin', wandrin' star.

I WHISTLE A HAPPY TUNE
Whenever I feel afraid, I hold my head erect
And whistle a happy tune so no one will suspect I'm afraid.
While shivering in my shoes, I strike a careless pose
And whistle a happy tune so no one ever knows I'm afraid.
	The result of this deception is very strange to tell,
	For when I fool the people I fear, I fool myself as well.
I whistle a happy tune, and every single time,
The happiness in the tune convinces me that I'm not afraid.
	Make believe you're brave, and the trick will take you far,
	You may as brave as you make believe you are
	(whistle)
	You may as brave as you make believe you are.

I (WHO HAVE NOTHING)
I, I who have nothing, I, I who have no one, adore you, and want you so
I'm just a no one, with nothing to give you, but oh, I Love You

He, he buys you diamonds, bight, sparkling diamonds, but believe me, dear, when I say,
That he can give you the world, but he'll never love you the way, I Love You
	He can take you anyplace he wants,  to fancy clubs and restaurants
	But I can only watch you with my nose pressed up against the window pane
I, I who have nothing, I, I who have no one, must watch you, go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else, when darling it's I
Who loves you, I Love You, I Love You, I Love You

I WILL
Who knows how long I've loved you, you know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime? If you want me to, I will.
For if I ever saw you I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered I will always feel the same
Love you forever and forever, love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together, love you when we're apart.
And when at last I find you your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me, ah, you know I will.....I will

I WILL WAIT FOR YOU
If it takes forever  I will  wait for you, for a thousand summers I will wait for you
Till you're back beside me, till I'm holding you, till I hear you sigh here in my arms.
Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go, every day remember how I love you so
In your heart believe what in my heart I know, that forevermore I'll wait for you.
	The clock will tick away the hours one by one,
	Then the time will come when all the waiting's done;
	The time when you return and find me here and run, straight to my waiting arms.
If it takes forever  I will  wait for you, for a thousand summers I will wait for you
Till you're back beside me, till I'm holding you, till I hear you sigh here in my arms.
Till you're back beside me, till I'm holding you, till I hear you sigh here in my arms.

I WISH I WERE IN LOVE AGAIN
The sleepless nights, the daily fights, the quick toboggan when you reach the heights,
I miss the kisses, and I miss the bites, I wish I were in love again!
The broken dates, the endless waits, the lovely loving and the hateful hates,
The conversation with the flying plates, I wish I were in love again!
	No more pain, no more strain, now I'm sane, but I  would rather be ga-ga!
The pulled out fur of cat and cur, the fine mis-mating of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were in love again.

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye, the words "I'll love you till the day I die."
The self-deception that believes the lie, I wish I were in love again!
When love congeals, it soon reveals the faint aroma of performing seals
The double crossing of a pair of heels, I wish I were in love again
	No more care, no despair, I'm all there now, but I'd rather be punch-drunk!
Believe me, sir, I much prefer the classic battle of a him and her
I don't like quiet and I wish I were in love again

I WISH YOU LOVE
Goodbye, no use leading with our chins, this is where our story ends, never lovers ever friends.
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day, but before you walk away, I sincerely want to say.
I wish you bluebirds in the spring, to give your heart a song to sing,
And then a kiss, but more than this, I wish you love.
And in July a lemonade to cool you in some leafy glade,
I wish you health, and more than wealth, I wish you love.
My foolish heart and I agree that you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.
I wish you shelter from the storm, a cozy fire to keep you warm,
But most of all, when snowflakes fall, I wish you love.
But most of all, when snowflakes fall, I wish you love.

I WISH I KNEW HOW IT WOULD FEEL TO BE FREE
I wish I knew how it would feel to be free
I wish I could break all these chains holding me
I wish I could say all the things that I should say
Say 'em loud say 'em clear for the whole wide world to  hear

I wish I could share all the love that's in my heart
Remove all the bars that keep us apart
And I wish you could know what it means to be me
Then you'd see  and agree that every  man should be free

I wish I could give all I'm longing to give
I wish I could live like I'm longing to live
I wish I could do all the things that I can do
Though I'm way  overdue, I'd be starting anew

I wish I could be like a bird in the sky
How sweet  it would be if I found I could fly
Well I'd soar to the sun and look down at the sea
Then I'd sing 'cause I'd know, yes I'd sing 'cause I'd know
Oh I'd sing 'cause I'd know how it feels  to be free

I WISH I WAS EIGHTEEN AGAIN
At a bar down in Dallas, an old man chimed in, and they thought he was out of his head
And, all being young men, they just laughed it off, when they heard what this old man said

He said, "I'll never again turn the young ladies' heads, or go running off into the wind
I'm three quarters home, from the start to the end, and I wish I was eighteen again."
	Oh, I wish I was eighteen again, and going where I've never been
	Now, old folks and old oaks, standing tall, just pretend, I wish I was eighteen again
Time turns the pages, and life goes so fast, the years turn the dark hair all gray
I talk to some young folks, but they don't understand the words this old man's got to say
	Oh, I wish I was eighteen again, and going where I've never been
	Now, old folks and old oaks, standing tall, just pretend, I wish I was eighteen again
	Oh, I wish I was eighteen again.

I WONDER WHO'S KISSING HER NOW
I wonder who's kissing her now, wonder who's teaching her how
Wonder who's looking into her eyes, breathing sighs, telling lies.
I wonder who's buying the wine for lips that I used to call mine
Wonder if she ever tells him 'bout me, I wonder who's kissing her now.

I WON'T LAST A DAY WITHOUT YOU
Day after day, I must face a world of strangers where I don't belong, I'm not that strong
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to who will always care, you're always there
     When there's no getting over that rainbow, when my smallest of dreams won't come true
      I can take all the madness the world has to give, but I won't last a day without you
So many times, when the city seems to be without a friendly face, a lonely place
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you, and you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile
     When there's no getting over that rainbow, when my smallest of dreams won't come true
      I can take all the madness the world has to give, but I won't last a day without you
　　　　Touch me, and I end up singing, troubles seem to up and disappear
　　　　You touch me with the love you're bringing, I can't really lose when you're near
If all my friends have forgotten half their promises, they're not unkind, just hard to find
One look at you, and I know that I could learn to live without the rest, I found the best
     When there's no getting over that rainbow, when my smallest of dreams won't come true
      I can take all the madness the world has to give, but I won't last a day without you

I WOULD LIKE TO DANCE
Look at me I would  like to dance, but I haven't the clothes for romance
So I'll stay with the boys in the band
I would like to be cool,  like the ladies who drool as they advance
But I can't get my feet to go where I lead with my toes

At the debutante's ball everybody does all they can do to enhance
Every corset in town in a gown made specially in France
And the men here can tell at a glance
I would like to main-tain, but it sure seems a shame to sit on my hands
And I only got into the swim by the seat of my pants
	   Not another woman in the world, who could make a living
               Pitching the light fandango, dancing on the streets of the city
               Look at me, playing freelance at the ball, catch my entrance to the hall
               Far from the gilded lily
Look at me, would you like to dance? I've a book illustrating the stance
And I can't get my head to go where I lead with my toes. I feel solo.........
	   Not another woman in the world, who could make a living
               Pitching the light fandango, dancing on the streets of the city
               Look at me, playing freelance at the ball, catch my entrance to the hall
               Far from the gilded lily

I WRITE THE SONGS
I've been alive forever, and I wrote the very first song
I put the words and the melodies together, I am music, and I write the songs
	I write the songs that make the whole world sing, I write the songs of love and special things
	I write the songs that make the young girls cry, I  write the songs, I write the songs
My home lies deep within you, and I've got my own place in your soul
Now, when I look out through your eyes, I'm young again, even though I'm very old
	I write the songs that make the whole world sing, I write the songs of love and special things
	I write the songs that make the young girls cry, I  write the songs, I write the songs
Oh, my music makes you dance, and gives you spirit to take a chance
And I wrote some rock and roll so you can move
Music fills your heart, well that's a real fine place to start
It's from me, it's for you, it's from you, it's for me, it's a world-wide symphony
	I write the songs that make the whole world sing, I write the songs of love and special things
	I write the songs that make the young girls cry, I  write the songs, I write the songs
	I am music, and I write the songs

IF
If a picture paints a thousand words, then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show the you I've come to know.
If a face could launch a thousand ships, then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you, you're all that's left, me too
　　　　And when my love for life is running dry, you come and pour yourself on me
If a man could be two places at one time, I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way
If the world should stop revolving, spinning slowly down to die,
I'd spend the end with you, and when the world was through
            Then, one by one, the stars would all go out, then you and I would simply fly away

IF EVER I WOULD LEAVE YOU
If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer. Seeing you in summer, I never would go
Your hair streaked with sunlight, your lips red as flame,
Your face with a luster that puts gold to shame

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn. How I'd leave in autumn, I never will know
I've seen how you sparkle when fall nips the air, I know you in autumn and I must be there
	And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
	Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow
If ever I would leave you, how could it be in springtime,
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no, not in springtime, summer, winter, or fall, no never could I leave you at all

IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU
Don't know why I'm sur-viving every lonely day,
When it's got to be no chance for me, my life would end,
And it doesn't matter how I cry, my tears of love are a waste of time.
If I turn away, am I strong enough to see it through? Go crazy is what I will do.
	If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby, if I can't have you, ah ah oh.
	If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby, if I can't have you, ah ah oh.
Can't let go, and it doesn't matter how I try.
I gave it all so easily to you, my love, to dreams that never will come true.
Am I strong enough to see it through ? Go crazy is what I will do.
	If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby, if I can't have you, ah ah oh.
	If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby, if I can't have you, ah ah oh.

IF I COULD BE WITH YOU
I'm so blue, I don't know what to do. All day through I'm pining just for you
I did wrong when I let you go away, and now I dream about you night and day
I'm unhappy and dissatisfied, but I'd be happy if I had you by my side....

If I could be with you, I'd love you strong, if I could be with you, I'd love ya long,
. . . want ya to know, I wouldn't go, until I told ya honey why I love ya so!
If I could be with you, one hour tonight, if I was free to do the things that I might,
I'm tellin' ya true, I'd be anythin' but blue,  if I could be with you, for just an hour,
If I could be with you!

IF I DIDN'T CARE
If I didn't care more than words can say, if I didn't care would I feel this way?
If this isn't love then why do I thrill?
And what makes my head go 'round and 'round, while my heart stands still?

If I didn't care would it be the same? Would my ev'ry prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?

And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?

IF I FELL
    If I fell in love with you, would you promise to be true, and help me understand?
    'Cause I've been in love before, and I found that love was more than just holding hands....
If I give my heart to you, I must be sure from the very start,
That you would love me more than her
If I trust in you, oh please, don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please, don't hurt my pride like her
    'Cause I couldn't stand the pain, and I would be sad if our new love was in vain.
So I hope you see that I would love to love you
And that she will cry when she learns we are two
So I hope you see that I would love to love you
And that she will cry when she learns we are two, if I fell in love with you ("if....you)X2.

IF I HAD A BOAT
       And if I had a boat, I'd go out on the ocean. And if I had a pony, I'd ride him on my boat
       And we could all together go out on the ocean, I said me upon my pony on my boat
And if I were Roy Rogers, I'd sure enough be single, I couldn't bring myself to marryin' old Dale
Well, it'd just be me and trigger, we'd go riding through them movies,
Then we'd buy a boat and on the sea we'd sail
       And if I had a boat, I'd go out on the ocean. And if I had a pony, I'd ride him on my boat
       And we could all together go out on the ocean, I said me upon my pony on my boat
Now the mystery masked man was smart, he got himself a Tonto
'Cause Tonto did the dirty work for free
But Tonto he was smarter, and one day said kemo sabe,
Kiss my ass I bought a boat, I'm going out to sea
       And if I had a boat, I'd go out on the ocean. And if I had a pony, I'd ride him on my boat
       And we could all together go out on the ocean, I said me upon my pony on my boat
And if I were like lightning, I wouldn't need no sneakers
Well, I'd come and go whenever I would please
And I'd scare 'em by the shade tree, and I'd scare 'em by the light pole
But I would not scare my pony on my boat out on the sea
       And if I had a boat, I'd go out on the ocean. And if I had a pony, I'd ride him on my boat
       And we could all together go out on the ocean, I said me upon my pony on my boat
       I say me upon my pony on my boat

IF I HAD A HAMMER
If I had a hammer, I'd hammer in the mor  -  ning
I'd hammer in the evening all over this land
I'd hammer out danger, I'd hammer out warning
I'd hammer out love between my brothers and my sisters
All  over this land

If I had a song, I'd sing it in the morning
I'd sing it in the evening all over this land
I'd sing out danger, I'd sing out warning
I'd sing out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

If I had a bell, I'd ring it in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening all over this land
I'd ring out danger, I'd ring out warning
I'd ring out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

Now I've got a hammer and I've got a bell
And I've got a song    to    sing all over this land
It's the hammer of justice, it's the bell of free—dom
It's the song about love between my brothers and my sisters
All ...over this land.  (Repeat last 3 lines)

IF I HAD WORDS
If I had words to make a day for you
I'd give you a morning golden and new
I would make this day last for all time
Give you a night deep in moonshine

IF I HAD YOU
I could show the world how to smile, I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blue if I had you.
I could leave the old days behind, leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all anew if I had you.
	I could climb the snowcapped mountains, sail the mighty ocean wide.
	I could cross the burning desert, if I had you by my side.
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned, humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do if I had you.

IF I LOVED YOU
If  I loved you, time and again I would try to say all I'd want you to know.
If  I loved you, words wouldn't come in an easy way, round in circles I'd go.
	Longing to tell you, but afraid and shy, I'd let my golden chances pass me by.
Soon you'd leave me, off you would go in the mist of day, never, never to know
How I loved you, if I loved you.

IF I KNEW YOU WERE COMIN'
If I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake, baked a cake, baked a cake
If I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a  cake, howd-ya do, howd-ya do, howd-ya do
Had you dropped me a letter, I'd a-hired a band, grandest band in the land
Had you dropped me a letter, I'd a-hired a band, and spread the welcome mat for you
	Oh, I don't know where you came from 'cause I don't know where you've been
	But it really doesn't matter, grab a chair and fill your platter, and dig, dig, dig right in
If I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake, hired a band, goodness sake
If I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake, howd-ya do, howd-ya do, howd-ya do
	Patty cake, patty cake, baker man, bake a cake as quick as you can
	Plenty of cream and sugar and ice,    nuts and raisins and honey  and spice
	Oh, I don't know where you came from 'cause I don't know where you've been
	But it really doesn't matter, grab a chair and fill your platter, and dig, dig, dig right in
If I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake, hired a band, goodness sake
If I knew you were comin' I'd've baked a cake, howd-ya do, howd-ya do, howd-ya do
Howd-ya do....., howd-ya do....., howd-ya do

IF I LOVED YOU
If  I loved you, time and again I would try to say all I'd want you to know.
If  I loved you, words wouldn't come in an easy way, round in circles I'd go.
	Longing to tell you, but afraid and shy, I'd let my golden chances pass me by.
Soon you'd leave me, off you would go in the mist of day, never, never to know
How I loved you, if I loved you.

IF I NEEDED SOMEONE
If I needed someone to love, you're the one that I´d be thinking of,  if I needed someone
If I had some more time to spend, then I guess I´d be with you my friend, if I needed someone
	Had you come some other day, then it might not have been like this
	But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall, and maybe you will get a call from me, if I needed someone

IF I ONLY HAD A BRAIN
I could while away the hours, conferrin' with the flowers, consulting with the rain,
And my head I'd be a-scratchin' while my thoughts were busy hatchin' if I only had a brain!
I'd unravel every riddle for any individdle in trouble or in pain
With the thoughts that I'd be thinkin', I could be another Lincoln if I only had a brain
Oh, I could tell you why, the ocean's near the shore
I could think of things I'd never thunk before,
And then I'd sit and think some more.
I would not be just a nuffin', my head all full of stuffin', my heart all full of pain.
And perhaps I'd deserve you and be even worthy erv you if I only had a brain.

IF I RULED THE WORLD
If I ruled the world, every day would be the first day of spring
Every heart would have a new song to sing
And we'd sing of the joy every morning would bring

If I ruled the world, every man would be as free as a bird
Every voice would be a voice to be heard
Take my word, we would treasure each day that occurred.
     My world would be a beautiful place, where we would weave such wonderful dreams.
     My world would wear a smile on its face, like the man in the moon has when the moon beams
If I ruled the world, every man would say the world was his friend
There'd be happiness that no man could end
	No, my friend, not if I ruled the world
	Every head would be held up high, there'd be sunshine in everyone's sky
	If the day ever dawned when I ruled the world

IF I WERE A CARPENTER
If I were a carpenter, and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway? Would you have my baby?

If a tinker were my trade, would you still find me
Carrying the pots I made, following behind me?
	Save my love through loneliness, save my love for sorrow
	I've given you my only-ness, come, give me your tomorrow
If I worked my hands in wood, would you still love me?
Answer me, babe: "yes I would, I'd put you above me"

If I were a miller, at a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your color box, your soft shoes shining

If I were a carpenter, and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway? Would you have my baby?
Would you marry me anyway? Would you have my baby?

IF WE ONLY HAVE LOVE
If we only have love then tomorrow will dawn
And the days of our years will rise on that morn'
If we only have love to embrace without fears
We will kiss with our eyes, we will sleep without tears
	If we only have love with our arms open wide
	Then the young and the old will stand at our side
	If we only have love, love that's falling like rain
	Then the parched desert earth will grow green again
	If we only have love for the hymn that we shout
	For the song that we sing, then we'll have a way out.
If we only have love, we can reach those in pain
We can heal all our wounds, we can use our own names
If we only have love, we can melt all the guns
And then give the new world to our daughters and sons
If we only have love then Jerusalem stands
And then death has no shadow, there are no foreign lands
	If we only have love, we will never bow down
	We'll be tall as the pines, neither heroes nor clowns
	If we only have love, then we'll only be men
	And we'll drink from the grail, to be born once again
	Then, with nothing at all, but the little we are
	We'll have conquered all time, all space, the sun and the stars.

IF YOU COULD READ MY MIND
If you could read my mind, love, what a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old-time movie, 'bout a ghost from a wishin' well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong, with chains upon my feet, you know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free, as long as I'm a ghost that you can't see

If I could read your mind, love, what a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel. the kind the drugstores sell
When you reach the part where the heartaches come, the hero would be me, but heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again, because the ending's just too hard to take
	I'd walk away like a movie star who gets burned in a three-way script, enter number two
	A movie queen to play the scene of bringing all the good things out in me
	But for now love, let's be real
	I never thought I could act this way, and I've got to say that I just don't get it
	I don't know where we went wrong, but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back
If you could read my mind, love, what a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old-time movie, 'bout a ghost from a wishin' well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong, with chains upon my feet,  but stories always end
And if you read between the lines, you'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand
The feelings that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way, and I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong, but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back

IF YOU DON'T KNOW ME BY NOW
	If you don't know me by now, you will never, never, never know me
All the things that we've been through, you should understand me, like I understand you
Now, baby, I know the difference between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing to upset our happy home
Oh, don't get so excited when I come home a little late at night
'Cause we only act like children when we argue, fuss and fight
	If you don't know me by now, you will never, never, never know me  (X2)
We all got our own funny moods, I got mine, woman, you've got yours too
Just trust in me, like I trust in you
As long as we've been together, that should be so easy to do,
Just get yourself together, or we might as well say goodbye,
What good is a love affair, when we can't see eye to eye?
	If you don't know me by now, you will never, never, never know me  (X2)

IF YOU GO AWAY
If you go away on this summer day, then you might as well take the sun away,
All the birds that flew in the summer sky, when our love was new, and our hearts were high,
When the day was young, and the night was long, and the moon stood still for the nightbird's song,
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away!
	But, if you stay, I'll make you a day like no day has been, or will be a-gain,
	We'll sail on the sun, we'll ride on the rain, we'll talk to the trees, and worship the wind,
	Then, if you go, I'll under-stand, leave me just enough love to hold in my hand,
	If you go a-way, if you go a-way, if you go a-way!
Ne me quitte pas, il faut oublier, tout peut s'oublier, qui s'en-fuit deja,
Oubli-er le temps, des mal-enten-dus, et le temps perdu, a savoir comment,
Oubli-er ces heures qui tu-aient parfois, a coup de "pourquois," le coeur du bonheur,
Ne me quitte pas, ne me quitte pas, ne me quitte pas!
	But, if you stay, I'll make you a night like no night has been, or will be a-gain,
	I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on  your touch, I'll talk to your eyes, that I love so much,
	Then, if you go, I'll under-stand, leave me just enough love to hold in my hand,
	If you go a-way, ne me quitte pas, if you go a-way!
If you go away, as I know you must, there'll be nothing left in this world to trust,
Just an empty room, full of empty space, like the empty look I see on your face,
Oh, I'd have been the shadow of your shadow, if it might have kept me by your side,
If you go away, ne me quitte pas, if you go away!

IF YOU KNEW SUSIE
I have got a sweetie known as Susie; in the words of Shakespeare she's a "wow"
Though all of you may know her too, I'd like to shout right now:

If you knew Susie like I know Susie, Oh! Oh! Oh! what a girl!
There's none so classy as this fair lassie, Oh! Oh! Holy Moses! what a chassis!
We went riding, she didn't balk; back from Yonkers, I'm the one that had to walk
If you knew Susie like I know Susie, Oh! Oh! What a girl!

IF YOU LEAVE ME NOW
If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, no, baby please don't go

And if you leave me now, you'll take away the very heart of me
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, no, baby please don't go
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, girl, I just want you to stay
           A love like ours is love that's hard to find. How could we let it slip a-way?
          We've come too far to leave it all behind. How could we end it all this way?
          When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret the things we said to-day

           A love like ours is love that's hard to find.         How could we let it slip a-way?
          We've come too far to leave it all be-hind.        How could we end it all this way?
          When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret the things we said to-day
If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, no, baby please don't go
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, no, baby please don't go

(IF YOU WANT IT) COME AND GET IT
If you want it, here it is come and get it, mmmm, make your mind up fast
If you want it, anytime I can give it, but you better hurry, 'cause it may not last
	Did I hear you say that there must be a catch,
	Will you walk away from a fool and his money
If you want it, here it is come and get it, but you better hurry, 'cause it's going fast

If you want it, here it is come and get it, mmmm, make your mind up fast
If you want it, anytime,  I can give it, but you better hurry, 'cause it may not last
	Did I hear you say that there must be a catch, will you walk away from a fool and his money
Sonny, if you want it, here it is come and get it, but you better hurry, 'cause it's going fast
You'd better hurry, 'cause it's going fast.........fool and his money

Sonny, if you want it, here it is come and get it, but you better hurry, 'cause it's going fast
You'd better hurry, 'cause it's going fast, you'd better hurry, 'cause it's going fast

IF YOU WANT THE RAINBOW
　　　　What does it matter if rain comes your way, and raindrops patter all day?
　　　　The rain descending should not make you blue.The happy ending is waiting for you
Take your share of trouble, face it and don't complain
       If you want the rainbow, you must have the rain.
Happi-ness comes double after a little pain
       If you want the rainbow, you must have the rain.
	What if your love affair should break up, as they sometimes will
	 When you kiss and make up, oh, what a thrill!
Sadness ends in gladness, showers are not in vain
1.        If you want the rainbow, you must have the rain.  (repeat song)
2.        If you want the rainbow, you must have the rain.
           If you want the rainbow, you must have the rain.


IF YOU WANT TO SING OUT
Well, if you want to sing out, sing out, and if you want to be free, be free
'Cause there's a million things to be, you know that there are

And if you want to live high, live high, and if you want to live low, live low
'Cause there's a million ways to go, you know that there are
	You can do what you want, the opportunity's on
	And if you can find a new way, you can do it today
	You can make it all true, and you can make it undo
	You see ah ah ah it's easy ah ah ah, you only need to know
Well if you want to say yes, say yes, and if you want to say no, say no
'Cause there's a million ways to go, you know that there are

And if you want to be me, be me, and if you want to be you, be you
'Cause there's a million things to do, you know that there are
	You can do what you want, the opportunity's on
	And if you can find a new way, you can do it today
	You can make it all true, and you can make it undo
	You see ah ah ah it's easy ah ah ah, you only need to know
Well, if you want to sing out, sing out, and if you want to be free, be free
'Cause there's a million things to be, you know that there are
You know that there are, you know that there are
You know that there are, you know that there are

IF YOU WERE THE ONLY GIRL IN THE WORLD
If you were the only girl in the world, and I were the only boy
Nothing else would matter in the world today,
We could go on loving in the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two, with nothing to mar our joy
I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If you were the only girl in the world, and I were the only boy.

IMAGINE
Imagine there's no heaven, it's easy, if you try. No hell below us, above us only sky.
Imagine all the people, living for today, ah ah

Imagine there's no countries, it isn't hard to do, nothing to kill or die form, and no religion too.
Imagine all the people, living life in peace, you...
	You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one
	I hope someday you'll join us, and the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions, I wonder if you can. No need for greed or hunger, a brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people, sharing all the world, you..
	You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one
	I hope someday you'll join us, and the world will be as one

IMAGINATION
Imagination is funny, it makes a cloudy day sunny,
It makes a bee think of honey, just as I think of you
Imagination is crazy, your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy, what to do, what to do
	Have you ever felt a gentle touch, and then a kiss, and then and then
	Find it's only your imagination again
Imagination is silly, you go around willy nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too

THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM
To dream the impossible dream, to fight the unbeatable foe
To bear, with unbearable sorrow, to run where the brave dare not go
To right the unrightable wrong, to love, pure and chaste from afar
To try, when your arms are too weary, to reach the unreachable star
　　　　This is my quest, to follow that star, no matter how hopeless, no matter how far
　　　　To fight for the right, without question or pause
　　　　To be willing to march into hell for that heavenly cause
　　　　And I know, if I'll only be true to this glorious quest
　　　　That my heart will lie peaceful and calm, when I'm laid to my rest
And the world will be better for this, that one man, scorned and covered with scars
Still strove, with his last ounce of courage, to reach the unreachable star

IN A MELLOW TONE
In a mellow tone, feelin' fancy free. And I'm not alone, I've got company
Everything's okay, the live-long day. With this mellow song, I can't go wrong

In a mellow tone, that's the way to live. If you mope and groan, something's got to give
So, go your way, and laugh and play. There's joy unknown, in a mellow tone.

In a mellow tone, that's the way to live. If you mope and groan, something's got to give
So, go your way, and laugh and play. There's joy unknown, in a mellow tone.

 (I'LL BE WITH YOU) IN APPLE BLOSSOM TIME
I'll be with you in apple blossom time, I'll be with you to change your name to mine.
One day in May, you'll come and say: "Happy's the bride the sun shines on today!"
What a wonderful wedding there will be, what a wonderful day for you and me!
Church bells will chime, you will be mine in apple blossom time. (repeat line)

IN MY LIFE
There are places I'll remember all my life though some have changed
Some forever, not for better, some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments with lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living, in my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers, there is no one compares with you
And these mem'ries lose their meaning when I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection for people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them, in my life I'll love you more

IN MY MERRY OLDSMOBILE
Come away with me, Lucile, in my merry Oldsmobile
Down the road of life we'll fly, automo-bubbling, you and I.
To the church we'll swiftly steal, then our wedding bells will peal,
You can go as far you like with me, in my merry Oldsmobile.

IN A SENTIMENTAL MOOD
In a sentimental mood, I can see the stars come through my room
While your loving attitude is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of every kiss, drifts a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss, you make my paradise complete,
	Rose petals seem to fall, it's all I could dream to call you mine,
	My heart's a lighter thing, since you made this night a thing divine
In a sentimental mood, I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt that you'd be loving sentimental me

IN A SHANTY IN OLD SHANTY TOWN
It's only a shanty in old Shanty Town, the roof is so slanty it touches the ground
But my tumbled down shack, by an old railroad  track,
Like a millionaire's mansion, is calling me back.
I'd give up a palace, if I were a king; it's more than a palace, it's my everything
There's a queen waiting there with a  silvery crown
In a shanty in old Shanty Town.

IN MY MERRY OLDSMOBILE
Young Johnny Steele has an Oldsmobile, and he loves his dear little girl
She is the queen of his gas machine, she has his heart in a whirl
Now when they go for a spin, you know, she tries to learn the auto, so
He lets her steer, while he gets her ear, and whispers soft and low...
	Come away with me, Lucille, in my merry Oldsmobile
	Down the road of life we'll fly, automobubbling, you and I
	To the church we'll swiftly steal, then our wedding bells will peal
	You can go as far as you like with me in my merry Oldsmobile.
They love to "spark" in the dark old park, as they go flying along
She says she knows why the motor goes, the "sparker" is awfully strong
Each day they spoon to the engine's tune, their honeymoon will happen soon
He'll win Lucille with his Oldsmobile, and then he'll fondly croon...
	Come away with me, Lucille, in my merry Oldsmobile
	Down the road of life we'll fly, automobubbling, you and I
	To the church we'll swiftly steal, then our wedding bells will peal
	You can go as far as you like with me in my merry Oldsmobile.

IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
       In the wee small hours of the morning, while the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl, and never ever think of counting sheep
　　　　When your lonely heart has learned its lesson, you'd be hers, if only she would call
	In the wee small hours of the morning, that's the time you miss her most of all
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson, you'd be hers, if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning, that's the time you miss her most of all

IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME
In the good old summertime, in the good old summer-time
Strolling through the shady lanes with your baby mine.
You hold her hand and she holds yours and that's a very good sign
That she's your tootsie-wootsie in the good old summertime.

IN THE MOOD
Who's the livin' dolly with the beautiful eyes?
What a pair of lips, I'd like to try 'em for size
I'll just tell her, "Baby, won't you swing it with me?"
Hope she tells me "maybe," what a wing it will be.
So I said politely, "Darlin, may I intrude?"
She said, "Don't keep me waiting when I'm in the mood."

First I held her lightly and we started to dance
Then I held her tightly what a dreamy romance
And I said, "Hey, baby, it's a quarter to three.
There's a mess of moonlight, won't you share it with me?
"Well," she answered, "Mister, don't-cha know that it's rude
To keep my two lips waitin' when they're in the mood."
	In the mood, that's what she told me. In the mood, and  when she told me,
	In the mood, my heart was skippin', it didn't take me long to say, "I'm in the mood."
	In the mood, for all her kissin', in the mood, her crazy lovin'
	In the mood, what I was missin', it didn't take me long to say, "I'm in the mood now."

IN THE SHADE OF THE OLD APPLE TREE
In the shade of the old apple tree, where the love in your eyes I could  see
When the voice that I heard, like the song of the bird, seemed to whisper sweet music to me
I could hear the dull buzz of the bee, in the blossoms, as you said to me
With a heart that is true, I'll be waiting for you, in the shade of the old apple tree.

IN THE STILL OF THE NIGHT-Cole Porter
In the still of the night, as I gaze from my window
At the moon in its flight, my thoughts all stray to you
In the still of the night, while the world is in slumber,
Oh, the times without number, darling, when I say to you:
"Do you love me as I love you? Are you my life to be, my dream come true?"
Or will this dream of mine fade out of sight
Like the moon, growing dim, on the rim of the hill, in the chill, still of the night?

IN THE STILL OF THE NIGHT-Five Satins
In the still of the night I held you, held you tight
'Cause I love, love you so, promise I'll never let you go, in the still of the night
	 I remember that night in May, the stars were bright above
	 I'll hope and I'll pray to keep your precious love
Well before the light, hold me a-gain with all of your might, in the still of the night
So before the light hold me a-gain with all of your might, in the still of the night
In the still .... of .... the night

IN 25  WORDS OR LESS
I like springtime flowers that grow along the lane,
I like sunshine showers and walking in the rain
I like a three day weekend and Sundays at the zoo
And in 25 words or less I'll tell you why I like you
	You got the sensational smile, irresistible eyes
	Oh but the fascinatin' thing about you is you look lonesome too
I like a wet martini but I take my whiskey neat
I like toast and honey cause that makes my morning sweet
I like a nightclub after hours, I like a Coleman Hawkins blues
And in 25 words or less I'll tell you why I like you
	You got the sensational smile, irresistible eyes
	Oh but the fascinatin' thing about you is you look lonesome too
I like a tropical island, I play my ukulele in the lagoon
I climb up the coconut tree and hula-hula with the local baboon
I like milkshakes, cupcakes, clambakes, sweepstakes, lazy afternoons
And in 25 words or less, I'll tell you why I like you
	You got the sensational smile, irresistible eyes
	Oh but the fascinatin' thing about you is you look lonesome, too, girl, with your
　　　　Sensational smile, irresistible eyes,
　　　　Oh but the fascinatin' thing about you is you look lonesome,
	I'm so lonesome, you look lonesome too

IN YOUR EASTER BONNET
In your Easter bonnet, with all the frills upon it, you'll be the grandest lady in the Easter Parade.
I'll be all in clover and when they look you over, I'll be the proudest fellow in the Easter Parade
On the avenue, Fifth Avenue, the photographers will snap us,
And you'll find that you're in the rotogravure.
Oh, I could write a sonnet about your Easter bonnet and of the girl I'm taking to the Easter Parade.

ISLAND IN THE SUN
This is my island in the sun, where my people have toiled since time begun
I may sail on many a sea, her shores will always be home to me
	Oh, island in the sun, willed to me by my father's hand
	All my days I will sing in praise of your forest waters, your shining sands
As morning breaks the heaven on high, I lift my heavy load to the sky
Sun comes down with a burning glow, mingles my sweat with the earth below
   	CHORUS
I see woman on bended knee, cutting cane for her family
I see man at the water side, casting nets at the surging tide.
	CHORUS
I hope the day will never come, when I can't awake to the sound of drum
Never let me miss carnival, with calypso songs philosophical
	CHORUS

ISN'T IT ROMANTIC
Isn't it romantic? Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic? Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
While all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic? Merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic? Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight, do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

ISN'T SHE LOVELY
Isn't she lovely, isn't she wonderful? Isn't she precious, less than one minute old
I never thought, through love we'd be making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely, made from love

Isn't she pretty, truly the angels' best. Boy, I'm so happy, we have been heaven blessed.
I can't believe what God has done, through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely, made from love

Isn't she lovely, life and love are the same. Life is Aisha, the meaning of her name
Londie, it could not have been done without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely, made from love

ISN'T THIS A LOVELY DAY
The weather is frightening, the thunder and lightning seem to be having their way
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
The turn in the weather will keep us together, so I can honestly say
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day and everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain
Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke, they broke and oh! what a break for me!
I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm
I can see where you and I  could be cozy and warm
Let the rain pitter patter, but it really doesn't matter if the skies are gray
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.

IS YOU IS OR IS YOU AIN'T MY BABY
I've got a gal who's always late, any time we have a date, but I love her, yes I love her
I'm gonna walk right up to her gate, and see if I can get it straight
'Cause I want her, I'm gonna ask her
      Is you is or is you ain't my baby, the way you're acting lately makes me doubt
     You have always been my baby  baby, seems my flame in your heart's done gone out
A woman is a creature that has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one, you find she's gone and made a change
Is you is or  is you ain't my baby, maybe baby's found somebody new
Is you is or  is you ain't my baby, maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true

IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOU
Lovers depend on moonlight, for a love affair. Babies depend on mothers for their tender care
Flowers depend on sunshine, and the morning dew
Each thing depends on something, and I depend on you

I can be happy, I can be sad, I can be good or I can be bad. It all depends on you
I can be lonely out in a crowd, I can be humble, I can be proud. It all  depends on you
	I can save money, or spend it, go right on living, or end it
	You're to blame, honey, for what I do,  I know that
I can be beggar, I can be king, I can be almost any old thing. It all depends on you.

IT CAME UPON A MIDNIGHT CLEAR
It came upon a midnight clear, that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth, to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heaven's all gracious king
The world in solemn stillness lay, to hear the angels sing
The world in solemn stillness lay, to hear the angels sing

IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU
Hide your heart from sight, lock your dreams at night, it could happen to you
Don't count stars or you might stumble. Someone drops a sigh and down you tumble

Keep an eye on spring, run when church bells ring, it could happen to you
All I did was wonder how your arms would be, and it happened to me

IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE
There you go and baby here am I, well, you left me here so I could sit and cry
Well, golly gee what have you done to me? Well, I guess it doesn't matter anymore
Do you remember baby last September, how you held me tight each and every night?
Well, whoopsy daisy, how you drove me crazy, but I guess it doesn't matter any-more
	There's no use in me a-cryin' I've done everything and now I'm sick of trying
	I've thrown away my nights, and wasted all my days over you
Well, you go your way and I'll go mine, now and forever, 'till the end of time
And I'll find somebody new,  baby, we'll say we're through, and you won't matter any-more
You won't matter any-more, no you won't matter any-more

IT DON'T COME EASY
	(It don't come easy, you know it don't come easy)
	(It don't come easy, you know it don't come easy)
Got to pay your dues, if you want to sing the blues, and you know it don't come easy
You don't have to shout or leap about, you can even play them easy
 	Forget about the past and all your sorrow
	The future won't last, it will soon be your tomorrow
I don't ask for much, I only want your trust, and you know it don't come easy
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time, and you know it just ain't easy
	Open up your heart, let's come together
	Use a little love, and we will make it work out better
Got to pay your dues, if you want to sing the blues, and you know it don't come easy
You don't have to shout or leap about, you can even play them easy
	Please remember peace is how we make it
	Here, within your reach, if you're big enough to take it
I don't ask for much, I only want your trust, and you know it don't come easy
And this love of mine keeps growin' all the time, and you know it don't come easy

IT DON'T MATTER TO ME
It don't matter to me, if you really feel that you need some time to be free
Time to go out searching for yourself, hoping to find time, to go to find

It don't matter to me, if you take up with someone who's better than me
'Cause your happiness is all I want for you to find peace, your peace of mind
	Lotta people have an ego hang-up, 'cause they want to be the only one
	How many came before? It really doesn't matter, just as long as you're the last
	Everybody's moving on, and try to find out what's been missing in the past
And it don't matter to me, if your searching brings you back together with me
'Cause there'll always be an empty room waiting for you, an open heart waiting for you
Time is on my side, 'cause it don't matter to me
     It don't matter to me  (X5)
'Cause there'll always be an empty room waiting for you, an open heart waiting for you
Time is on my side, 'cause it don't matter to me

IT HAD TO BE YOU
It had to be you, it had to be you I wandered around and finally found somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blueAnd even be glad, just to be sad, thinking of you.
Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss, but they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill, with all your faults I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you.

IT HURTS TO BE IN LOVE
It hurts to be in love, when the only one you love
Turns out to be someone who's not in love with you.
It hurts to love her so, when deep down inside you know,
She will never want you, no matter what you do.
      And so you cry a little bit, oh, you die a little bit
      Day and night, night and day, it hurts to be in love this way.
How long can I exist? Wanting lips I've never kissed
She gives all her kisses, to somebody else.
She thinks I'm just a friend. Though it hurts, I must pretend
The only way to keep her, is keep it to myself.
      And so you cry a little bit, oh, you die a little bit
      Day and night, night and day, it hurts to be in love this way.

      And so you cry a little bit, oh, you die a little bit
      Day and night, night and day, it hurts to be in love this way.
It hurts to be in love, day and night, night and day
It hurts to be in love. night and day, day and night
It hurts to be in love, day and night, night and day...

IT MIGHT AS WELL BE SPRING
I'm as restless as a willow in a wind-storm, I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever, but I know it isn't spring.
I am starry eyed and vaguely discontented, like a nightingale without a song to sing.
Oh, why should I have spring fever when it isn't even spring?
	I keep wishing I were somewhere else, walking down a strange new street
	Hearing words that I have never heard from a girl I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as a spider spinning day-dreams, I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing.
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud, or a robin on the wing,
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way that it might as well be spring
It might as well be spring.

IT MIGHT AS WELL RAIN UNTIL SEPTEMBER
	What should I write? What can I say? How can I tell you how much I miss you?
The weather here has been as nice as it can be, although it doesn't really matter much to me
For all the fun I'll have while you're so far away, it might as well rain until September
I don't need sunny skies for things I have to do
'Cause I stay home the whole day long and think of you
As far as I'm concerned each day's a rainy day, so It might as well rain until September
	My friends look forward to their picnics on the beach, yes everybody loves the summertime
	But you know darling while your arms are out of reach,	the summer isn't any friend of mine,
It doesn't matter whether skies are gray or blue, it's raining in my heart 'cause I can't be with you
I'm only living for the day you're home to stay, so It might as well rain until September
September, September, oh it might as well rain until September
September, September, oh it might as well rain until September

IT NEVER RAINS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
Got on a board a west bound seven forty-seven.  Didn't think before deciding what to do
All that talk of opportunities, TV breaks and movies rang true, sure rang true.
     Seems it never rains in Southern California. Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
     It never rains in California, but girls, don't they warn ya, "It pours, man it pours."
Out of work, I'm out of my head, out of self-respect,  I'm out of bread
I'm under-loved, I'm under-fed, I wanna go home.
	It never rains in Cali-fornia, but girls, don't they warn ya, "It pours, man it pours."
Will you tell the folks back home I nearly made it? Had offers but don't know which one to take
Please don't tell 'em how you found me, don't tell 'em how you found me
	Gimme a break, gimme a break.
     Seems it never rains in Southern California. Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
     It never rains in California, but girls, don't they warn ya, "It pours, man it pours."

IT ONLY TAKES A MOMENT
It only takes a moment for your eyes to meet and then
Your heart knows, in a moment, you will never be alone again
I held her for an instant, but my arms felt sure and strong
It only takes a moment to be loved a whole life long
	I've heard it said that love must grow, that to be sure, you must be slow
	I saw you smile, and now I know, I'll listen to just my heart,
	That smile made me trust my heart,
For it only takes a moment for your eyes to meet and then
Your heart knows, in a moment, you will never be alone again
I held her for an instant, but my arms felt sure and strong
It only takes a moment to be loved a whole life long
And that is all that love's about, and we'll recall when time runs out,
That it only took a moment to be loved a whole life long.

IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MORNING
It's a beautiful mornin', ah, I think I'll go outside for a while
 (And just smile)  Just take in some clean fresh air, boy!
 (Ain't no sense in stayin' inside) If the weather's fine, and you've got the time,
       It's your chance to wake up and plan another brand new day (Either way)
It's a beautiful mornin', ah, each bird keeps sing-in' his own song
 (So long!) I've got to be on my way now
(Ain't no fun just hangin' around) I've got to cover ground, you couldn't keep me down
      It just ain't no good if the sun shines, when you're still inside
 (Shouldn't hide)  still inside, (shouldn't hide) Ah, oh! (Shouldn't hide) Ah, ah, oh

There will be children with robins and flowers, sunshine caresses each new waking hour
       Seems to me that people keep seeing more and more each day; (Gotta say)
Lead the way, (it's okay), Wednesday, gotta say, it's o-kay, Wednesday, gotta say, lead the way
Whoa,  oh, oh, oh  It's a beautiful mornin'!

IT'S A BIG, WIDE, WONDERFUL WORLD
It's a big, wide, wonderful world you live in,
When you're in love, you're a master of all you survey, you're a gay Santa Claus
There's a brave new star-spangled sky above you
When you're in love you're a hero, a Nero, Apollo, a Wizard of Oz
	You've a kingdom, power and glory the old, old, oldest of stories
	It's new, true, you've built your Rome in just one day
Life is mystic, a mid-summer's night you live in
A Turkish delight, you're in heaven, it's swell when you're really in love

It's a big, wide, wonderful world you live in,
When you're in love, you're a master of all you survey, you're a gay Santa Claus
	You've a kingdom, power and glory the old, old, oldest of stories
	It's new, true, you've built your Rome in just one day
Life is mystic, a mid-summer's night you live in
A Turkish delight, you're in heaven, it's grand when you're really in love
You're in heaven, it's grand when you're really in love

IT'S A BLUE WORLD
It's a blue world without you, it's a blue world  alone
My days and nights that once were filled with heaven
With you away how empty they have grown.
It's a blue world from now on, it's a through world for me
The sea, the sky, my heart and  I we're all an indigo hue
Without you it's a blue, blue world.

IT'S A GOOD DAY
Yes, it's a good day for singing a song, and it's a good day for moving along
Yes, it's a good day, how could anything go wrong? A good day from morning' till night
Yes, it's a good day for shining your shoes, and it's a good day for losing the blues;
Everything to gain and nothing' to lose,  `cause it's a good day from morning' till night
	I said to the Sun, " Good morning sun, rise and shine today"
	You know you've gotta get goin', if you're gonna make a showin'
	And you know you've got the right of way.
`Cause it's a good day for paying your bills, and it's a good day for curing your ills,
So take a deep breath and throw away your pills,`cause it's a good day from morning' till night.

IT'S A GRAND NIGHT FOR SINGING
It's a grand night for singing, the moon is flying high,
And somewhere a bird who is bound he'll be heard is throwing his heart at the sky!
It's a grand night for singing, the stars are bright above.
The earth is a-glow, and to add to the show, I think I am falling in love!  Falling, falling in love.
	Maybe it's more than the moon, maybe it's more than the birds,
	Maybe it's more than sight of the night, in a light, too lovely for words.
	Maybe it's more than the earth, shiny, and silvery blue.
	Maybe the reason I'm feeling this way has something to do with you!
It's a grand night...................

IT'S ALL IN THE GAME
Many a tear has to fall, but it's all in the game
All in the wonderful game, that we know as love
	You had words with him, and your future's looking dim
	But these things your heart can rise above
Once in a while he won't call, but it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side, with a sweet bouquet
      And he'll kiss your lips, and caress your waiting fingertips, and your hearts will fly, away
Soon he'll be there at your side, with a sweet bouquet
      Then he'll kiss your lips, and caress your waiting fingertips, and your hearts will fly away

IT'S ALL OVER NOW
Well, baby used to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie
Tables turn and now her turn to cry
	Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
	Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money, playing her high class game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Tables turn and now her turn to cry
	Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
	Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Well, I used to wake in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I'd gotten worried she'd ease my aching head
But now she's here and there, with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown
	Because I used to love her, but it's all over now (X3)

IT'S ALL RIGHT
Say it's all right, it's all right. Say it's all right, it's all right
It's all right, have a good time, 'cause it's all right, whoa, it's all right
We're gonna move it slow when lights are low
When you move it slow, it sounds like more, and it's all right, whoa, it's all right
Now listen to the beat, kinda pat your feet
You've got soul, and everybody knows that it's all right, whoa, it's all right
	When you wake up early in the morning, feelin' sad like so many of us do
	Hum a little soul, make life your goal, and surely something's got to come to you
And say it's all right, say it's all right
It's all right, have a good time, 'cause it's all right, whoa, it's all right
Now everybody clap your hands, give yourself a chance
You got soul, and everybody knows that it's all right, whoa, it's all right
	Someday I'll find me a woman who will love and treat me real nice
	Then my woes got to go, and my love, she will know from morning, noon and night
And she's got to say it's all right, say it's all right
It's all right, have a good time, 'cause it's all right, whoa, it's all right
Everybody clap your hands, now give yourselves a chance

IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME
It's the wrong time, and the wrong place; though your face is charming, it's the wrong face
It's not her face, but such a charming face, that it's all right with me
It's the wrong song, in the wrong style though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile
It's not her smile, but such a lovely smile that it's all right with me
	You can't know how happy I am that we met I'm strangely attracted to you
	There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget don't you want to forget someone, too?
It's the wrong game, with the wrong chips though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips
They're not her lips, but they're such tempting lips that, if some night, you are free
Then it's all right, yes, it's all right with me

IT'S A LOVELY DAY TODAY
It's a lovely day today, so whatever you've got to do
You've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true.
	And I hope whatever you've got to do is something that can be done by two.
	For I'd really like to stay.
It's a lovely day today, and whatever you've got to do
I'd be so happy to be doing it with you.
	But if you've got something that must be done, and it can only be done by one,
	There is nothing more to say, except it's a lovely day for saying it's a lovely day.

IT'S A MOST UNUSUAL DAY
It's a most unusual day, feel like throwing my worries away
As an old native born Californian would say, "It's a most unusual day.
There's a most unusual sky, not a sign of a cloud passing by
And if I want to sing, throw my heart in the ring, it's a most unusual day
	There are people, meeting people, there is sunshine everywhere
	There are people, greeting people, and a feeling of spring in the air
It's a most unusual time, I keep feeling my temperature climb,
If my heart won't behave in the usual way, well there's only one thing to say
It's a most unusual, most unusual, most unusual day.

IT'S A SIN TO TELL A LIE
Be sure it's true when you say, "I love you," IT'S A SIN TO TELL A LIE!
Many poor hearts have been broken,   just because those words are spok - en.
I love   you, yes I do, I   love you.  If you break my heart I'll die.
So be sure it's true when you say, "I love you,"
IT'S A SIN.......TO TELL......A LIE!

IT'S DE-LOVELY
The night is young, the sky is clear, and if you want to go walking, dear
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely
I understand the reason why you're sentimental 'cause so am I
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely
You can tell at a glance what a swell night this is for romance
You can hear Mother Nature murmuring low. Let yourself go!
So please be sweet, my chickadee, and when I kiss you, just say to me
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's delectable, it's delirious,
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, it's de-lovely

IT'S BEEN A LONG, LONG TIME
Kiss me once, then kiss me twice, then kiss me once again. It's been a long, long time.
Haven't felt like this, my dear, since I can't remember when. It's been a long, long time
	You'll never know how many dreams I've dreamed about you.
	Or just how empty they all seemed without you.
Kiss me once, then kiss me twice, then kiss me once again. It's been a long, long time.

IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE CHRISTMAS
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, everywhere you go
Take a look in the Five and Ten, glistening once again,
	With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be on your own front door.
	A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots is the wish of Barney and Ben
	Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk is the hope of Janice and Jen
	And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park, as well
	The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
	Right within your heart, right within........ your........ heart.

IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME THIS TIME
It's going to take some time this time to get myself in shape
I really feel out of line this time, I really missed the gate
	The birds on the telephone line (next time) are cryin' out to me (next time)
	And I won't be so blind next time, and I'll find some harmony
But it's going to take some time this time, and I can't make demands
But like the young trees in the wintertime, I'll learn how to bend
	After all the tears we've spent, how could we make amends
	So it's one more round for experience, and I'm on the road again
	And it's going to take some time this time
It's going to take some time this time, no matter what I've planned
But like the young trees in the wintertime, I'll learn how to bend
	After all the tears we've spent, how could we make amends
	So it's one more round for experience, and I'm on the road again
	And it's going to take some time this time

IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
It's impossible, tell the sun to leave the sky, it's just impossible
It's impossible, ask a baby not to cry, it's just impossible
	Can I hold you closer to me, and not feel you going through me
	Split the second that I never think of you, oh, how impossible
Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore, it's just impossible
If I had you, could I ever want for more, it's just impossible
And tomorrow, should you ask me for the world, somehow I'd get it
I would sell my very soul, and not regret it,
For to live without your love, it's just impossible

IT'S IN HER (HIS) KISS
	Does she love me, I wanna know, how can I tell if she loves me so.
(Is it in her eyes?) Oh, no, you'll be deceived, (Is it in her eyes?) Oh, no, she'll make believe,
If you wanna know if she loves you so, it's in her kiss (That's where it is-oh, yeah!)
( Or is it in her face?) Oh, no, that's just her charm (In her warm embrace?) Oh, no, that's just her arms
If you wanna know if she loves you so, it's in her kiss (That's where it is)
Oh, oh, it's in her kiss (That's where it is!)
	Oh, oh, oh, hug her, and squeeze her tight, to find out what you want to know
	If it's love, if it really is, it's there in her kiss
	(How 'bout the way she acts?) Oh, no, that's not the way, you're not listenin' to all I say
If you wanna know if she loves you so, it's in her kiss (That's where it is!)
Oh, yeah, it's in her kiss (That's where it is!)
	Oh, oh, oh, hug her, and squeeze her tight, to find out what you want to know
	If it's love, if it really is, it's there in her kiss
	(How 'bout the way she acts?) Oh, no, that's not the way, you're not listenin' to all I say
If you wanna know if she loves you so, it's in her kiss (That's where it is!)
Oh, yeah, it's in her kiss (That's where it is!)
Oh, yeah, it's in her kiss (That's where it is!)

IT'S LIKE REACHING FOR THE MOON
It's like reaching for the moon. It's like reaching for the sun
It's like reaching for the stars, reaching for you
	You're so far above me, how can I expect an angel to love me
	Who is so divine as you are?
It's like flying without wings, playing fiddle without strings
And a million other things no one can do
Though, my hopes are slender, in my secret heart, I pray you'll surrender soon
Though, it's like reaching for the moon

IT'S MY PARTY
Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone, but Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand, when he's supposed to hold mine?
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
Here are my records, keep dancing all night, but leave me alone for a while
'Til Johnny's dancing with me, I've got no reason to smile
It's my party....
Judy and Johnny just walked thru the door like a queen and her king
Oh, what a perfect surprise, Judy's wearing his ring
It's my party....

IT'S NICE WEATHER FOR DUCKS
It's nice weather for ducks, I know they find it a-musing
It won't inhibit their cruising, it's nice weather for ducks

It's nice weather for eels,  I'm sure they find it "app-eeling"
'Cause no one wants to go eeling,  nice weather for eels
	The girl and boy ducks love the rain, the she eel  has the he eel
	But no one cares when I com-plain, how miserable I fe -eel
Nice weather for ducks, it's wet below and above them
But they have someone who loves them, it's nice weather for ducks.

It's nice weather for frogs, il fait très  beau for the fishes
They think it's simply delicious, nice weather for frogs

It's nice weather for grass  and all the rest of those green things
And you know, man, like I mean things, nice weather for grass.
	It's sweet to share a love affair when rainy days confine us
	But Cupid's given  me the air, and all I get is sinus!
It's nice weather for ducks, I know they simply adore it
But as for me I abhor it,  so I'll just try to ignore it
They're so lucky, for it's so ducky for.......ducks.

IT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY
It's not for me to say.....you   love   me. It's not for me to say....you'll always care.
	Oh, but here, for the moment, I can hold you fast,
	And press your lips to mine, and dream that love will last.
As far as I can see....this is heaven. And speaking just for me....it's ours to share.
	Perhaps the glow of love will grow with every passing day.
	Or we may never meet a-gain, but then, it's not for me to say.

IT'S NOT UNUSUAL
It's not unusual to be loved by anyone. It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
But when I see you hanging about with anyone, it's not unusual to see me cry, I wanna die

It's not unusual to go out at any time, but when I see you out and about it's such a crime
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone, it's not unusual it happens every day
	No matter what you say, you'll find it happens all the time
	Love will never do what you want it to. Why can't this crazy love be mine
It's not unusual to be mad with anyone. It's not unusual to be sad with anyone
But if I ever find that you've changed at any time
It's not unusual to find out I'm in love with you
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.......................

IT'S NOW OR NEVER
	It's now or never, come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling, be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late, it's now or never, my love won't wait.
When I first saw you, with your smile so tender
My heart was captured, my soul surrendered
I'd spent a lifetime, waiting for the right time
Now that you're near, the time is here at last.
            It's now or never, ......
Just like a willow, we would cry an ocean
If we lost true love, and sweet devotion
Your lips excite me, let your arms invite me
For who knows when we'll meet again this way
            It's now or never, come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling, be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late, it's now or never, my love won't wait.
It's now or never, my love won't wait  (X3)

IT'S ONLY A PAPER MOON
Say, it's only a paper moon sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make believe if you believed in me.
Yes, it's only a canvas sky hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make believe if you believed in me.
	Without your love, it's a honky-tonk parade.
	Without your love, it's a melody played in a penny arcade.
It's a Barnum and Bailey world, just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make believe if you believed.......if you believed.....
If you.. be..lieved.. in.. me.

IT'S ONLY LOVE
I get high when I see you go by, my oh my.
When you sigh my, mind inside just flies, butterflies.
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
	It's only love and that is all, why should I feel the way I do?
	It's only love and that is all, but it's so hard loving you
Is it right that you and I should fight, every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, very bright.
Haven't I the right to make it up, girl?
	It's only love and that is all........

IT'S ONLY MAKE BELIEVE
	People see us everywhere, they think you really care
	But myself I can't deceive, I know it's only make believe
My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care,
My hopes, my dreams come true, my one and only you.
No one will ever know how much I love you so
My only prayer will be someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe.
	My hopes, my dreams come true, my life I'd give for you,
	My heart, a wedding ring, my all, my everything.
	My heart I can't control, you rule my very soul,
	My only prayer will be someday you'll care for me
	But it's only make believe.
My one and only prayer, is that some day you'll care,
My hopes, my dreams come true, my one and only you
No one will ever know how much I love you so
My prayers, my hopes, my schemes, you are my every dream
But it's only make believe (Make believe)

IT'S SO EASY
	It's so easy to fall in love, it's so easy to fall in love
People tell me love's for fools, so here I go, breakin' all the rules
It seems so easy, so doggone easy, it seems so easy, where you're concerned, my heart has learned
	It's so easy to fall in love, it's so easy to fall in love
Look into your heart and see what your love book has set apart for me
It seems so easy, so doggone easy, it seems so easy, where you're concerned, my heart has learned
	It's so easy to fall in love, it's so easy to fall in love

IT'S SO NICE TO BE WITH YOU
	Oh, it's so nice to be with you, I love all the things you say and do
	And it's so nice to hear you say you're gonna please me in every way
	Honey, I got the notion you're causin' commotion in my soul
Baby, you and me have got somethin' that's real, I know it's gonna last a lifetime,
oh, you better believe it, girl
At night I call your name, darkness fills my room, I'm only dreamin'
About the time I'm gonna be with you
	Oh, it's so nice to be with you, I love all the things you say and do
	And it's so nice to hear you say you're gonna please me in every way
	Honey, I got the notion you're causin' commotion in my soul
When I'm feelin' down, you're there to pick me up, and help me to carry on
Oh, little things mean a lot
When you need a shoulder to cry on, I'm there to ease the pain, and chase away the rain
Oh, darlin', I just gotta say
	Oh, it's so nice to be with you, I love all the things you say and do
	And it's so nice to hear you say you're gonna please me in every way  (X2)
	Honey, I got the notion you're causin' commotion in my soul  (X2)

IT'S STILL ROCK AND ROLL TO ME
What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing? Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars? Welcome back to the age of jive.
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey? You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money"
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound. Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me.

What's the matter with the car I'm driving? Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set of white wall tires? Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental. Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental."
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk, it's still rock and roll to me.
     Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers, 'cause it's always been the same old scene.
     There's a new band in town but you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine.
     Aimed at your average teen.
How about a pair of pink sidewinders and a bright orange pair of pants?
Well, you could really be a Beau Brummel baby, if you just give it half a chance.
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers.
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers."
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways, it's still rock and roll to me.

What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing? Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Well, should I try to be a straight 'A' student?" If you are, then you think too much."
Don't you know about the new fashion, honey? All you need are looks and a whole lota money."
It's the next phase, new wave, dance craze; anyways, it's still rock and roll to me.
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound. Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me.

IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR
It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year
With the kids Jingle Belling, and everyone telling you "Be of good cheer"
It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year, it's the hap-happiest sea son of all
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings, when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all
     There'll be parties for hosting, marshmallows for toasting, and caroling out in the snow
     There'll be scary ghost stories, and tales of the glories of Christmases long, long a-go
It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year
There'll be much mistle-toeing, and hearts will be glowing, when loved ones are near
It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year
     There'll be parties for hosting, marshmallows for toasting, and caroling out in the snow
     There'll be scary ghost stories, and tales of the glories of Christmases (long, long ago)
It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year
There'll be much mistle-toeing, and hearts will be glowing, when loved ones are near
It's The Most Wonderful Time, yes, The Most Wonderful Time
It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year

IT'S THE SAME OLD SONG
You're sweet  as a honey bee, but like a honey bee stings, you've gone and left my heart in pain
All you left, is our favorite song, the one we danced to all night long
It used to bring sweet memories of a tender love that used to be
	Now it's the same old song, but with a different meaning, Since you've been gone
	It's the same old song, but with a different meaning, Since you've been gone
A sentimental fool am I, to hear an old love song and wanna cry
But the melody keeps haunting me, reminding me how in love we used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our hearts, saying together forever, breaking up never
	Now it's the same old song, but with a different meaning, Since you've been gone
	It's the same old song, but with a different meaning, Since you've been gone
Baby, I need your lovin', baby I need your lovin'
Precious memories keep a lingering on, every time I hear our favorite song
Now you're gone, left this emptiness, I only reminisce, the happiness we spent
We used to dance to the music (we used to dance to the music)
Make romance to the music (make romance to the music)
	Now it's the same old song, but with a different meaning, since you've been gone
	It's the same old song, but with a different meaning, since you've been gone

BABY, I NEED YOUR LOVIN'
     	Baby, I need your lovin', baby I need your lovin',
Although you're never near, your voice I often hear
Another day, an-other night, I long to hold you tight, 'cause I'm so lonely
	      Baby, I need your lovin', got to have all your lovin'
	      Baby, I need your lovin', got to have all your lovin'
Some say it's a sign of weakness  for a man to beg
Then weak I would rather be, if it means havin' you to keep, 'cause lately I've been losin' sleep
	    Every night I call your name. Sometimes I wonder, will I ever be the same.
When you see me smile, you know things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see,  has all been rehearsed
Darling, I can't go on without you,  this emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness in-side me, darlin', makes me feel  half alive.
	      Baby, I need your lovin', got to have all your lovin'
	      Baby, I need your lovin', got to have all your lovin'
	      Baby, I need your lovin'.

IT'S TOO LATE
Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
There's something wrong here, there can be no denying
One of us is changing, or maybe we've stopped trying
	And it's too late, baby, now it's too late, though we really did try to make it
	Something inside has died and I can't hide and I just can't fake it
It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool
There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it too
Still I'm glad for what we had, and how I once loved you
	But it's too late, baby, it's too late, though we really did try to make it
	Something inside has died and I can't hide and I just can't fake it

ITSY BITSY TEENIE WEENIE YELLOW POLKA DOT BIKINI
She was afraid to come out of the locker, she was as nervous as she could be
She was afraid to come out of the locker, she was afraid that somebody would see (2,3,4  tell....)
 	It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini that she wore for the first time today
	An itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini,
	So in the locker she wanted to stay (2,3,4  stick....)
She was afraid to come out in the open, and so a blanket around her she wore
She was afraid to come out in the open, and so she sat bundled up on the shore (2,3,4  tell....)
	It was an itsy bitsy ......
Now she's afraid to come out of the water, and I wonder what she's gonna do
Now she's afraid to come out of the water, and the poor little girl's turning blue  (2,3,4  tell....)
	It was an itsy bitsy ......
From the locker to the blanket, from the blanket to the shore
From the shore to the water, guess there isn't any more!

JAILHOUSE ROCK
1.The warden threw a party in the county jail. The prison band was there and they began to wail.
2.Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone, Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone.
3.Number forty-seven said to number three: "You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see.
4.The sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone, way over in the corner weepin' all alone.
5.Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake, no one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break."

1. The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing. You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing.
2.The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang, the whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang.
3.I sure would be delighted with your company, Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me."
4.The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square. If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair."
5.Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix, I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks."

     Let's rock, everybody, let's rock. Every-body in the whole cell block was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.

JAMAICA FAREWELL
Down the way where the nights are gay and the sun shines daily on the mountain top,
I took a trip on a sailing ship and when I reach Jamaica I make a stop, but I'm
   CHORUS:
	Sad to say I'm on my way, won't be back for many a day
	My heart is down my head is turning around
	I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
Sounds of laughter everywhere and the dancin' girls swing to and fro
I must declare my heart is there, though I been from Maine to Mexico, but I'm
   CHORUS
Down at the market you can hear ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
Ake rice, salt fish are nice, and the rum is fine anytime of year, but I'm
   CHORUS

JAMBALYA
Goodbye, Joe, me gotta go, me oh my-o, me gotta go, pole the pirogue down the bayou.
My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh my-o, son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and a filé gumbo,
	'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma chere amie-o.
	Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o,
	Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.
Thibodaux, Fontaineaux, the place is buzzin', kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen.
Dress in style and go hog wild, me oh my-o, son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.
	Jambalaya......

JEEPERS CREEPERS
I don't care what the weather man says, when the weatherman says it's raining,
You'll never hear me complaining, I'm certain the sun will shine,
I don't care how the weather vane points, when the weather vane points to gloomy,
It's gotta be sunny to me, when your eyes look into mine;
Jeepers Creepers! Where'd ya get those peepers? Jeepers Creepers! Where'd ya get those eyes?
Gosh all git up! How'd they get so lit up? Gosh all git up! How'd they get that size?
Golly gee! When you turn those heaters on, woe is me! Got to put my cheaters on,
Jeepers Creepers! Where'd ya get those peepers? On! Those weepers! How they hypnotize!
Where'd ya get those eyes? Where'd ya get those eyes?

JENNIFER JUNIPER
Jennifer Juniper, lives upon the hill. Jennifer Juniper, sitting very still
Is she sleeping? I don't think so. Is she breathing? Yes, very low,
Whatcha doing, Jennifer, my love?

Jennifer Juniper, rides a dappled mare. Jennifer Juniper, lilacs in her hair
Is she dreaming? Yes, I think so. Is she pretty? Yes, ever so
Whatcha doing, Jennifer, my love?
	I'm thinking of what it would be like if she loved me
	How just lately this happy song, it came along, and I like to somehow try and tell you
Jennifer Juniper, hair of golden flax. Jennifer Juniper, longs for what she lacks
Do you like her? Yes, I do, sir. Would you love her? Yes, I would, sir
Whatcha doing, Jennifer, my love?
	Jennifer Juniper, Jennifer Juniper, Jennifer Juniper
Jennifer Juniper, vit sur la colline. Jennifer Juniper, assise très tranquille
Dort-elle? Je ne crois pas. Respire-t-elle? Oui, mais tout bas
Qu'est-ce que tu fais, Jenny, mon amour?
	Jennifer Juniper, Jennifer Juniper, Jennifer Juniper

JENNY (or JIMMY) MACK
Jenny Mack, Jenny, oh, Jenny Mack, when are you comin' back?
Jenny Mack, Jenny, oh, Jenny Mack, when are you comin' back?

My arms are missing you, my lips feel the same way too.
I tried so hard to be true, like I promised I'd do.
But this girl/boy keeps comin' around, tryin' to wear my resistance down.
	Hey Jenny, Jenny, oh, Jenny Mack, when are you comin' back.
	Jenny, Jenny, oh Jenny Mack, you better hurry back.
She/He calls me on the phone about three times a day.
Now my heart's just listening to, what she/he has to say
But this loneliness I have within, keeps reaching out to be her/his friend
	Hey Jenny, Jenny, oh, Jenny Mack, when are you comin' back.
	Jenny, Jenny, oh Jenny Mack, you better hurry back. Need your loving, need your loving.
I wanna say I'm not getting any stronger, I can't hold out very much longer
Trying hard, to be true, but, Jenny, she/he talks just as sweet as you.
	Hey Jenny, Jenny, oh, Jenny Mack, when are you comin' back.
	Jenny, Jenny, oh Jenny Mack, you better hurry back.
	Jenny, Jenny, oh Jenny Mack, you better hurry back.

JIM DANDY
	Jim Dandy to the rescue (X3) Go, Jim Dandy, Go Jim Dandy
Jim Dandy on a mountain top, thirty thousand feet to drop
Spied a lady on a runaway horse, uh huh, that's right, of course
Jim Dandy to the rescue, go, Jim Dandy, go, Jim Dandy

Jim Dandy met a girl named Sue. She was feelin' kind of blue
Jim Dandy, he's the kind of guy, never liked to see a little girl cry
Jim Dandy to the rescue, go, Jim Dandy, go, Jim Dandy
	Jim Dandy to the rescue (X3) Go, Jim Dandy, Go
Jim Dandy had a submarine, got a message from a mermaid queen
She was hangin' from a fishin' line, Jim Dandy didn't waste no time
Jim Dandy to the rescue, go, Jim Dandy, go, Jim Dandy

Jim Dandy wanted to go to Maine, got a ticket on a D.C. plane
Jim Dandy didn't need no suit, he was hip, and ready to boot
Jim Dandy to the rescue, go, Jim Dandy, go, Jim Dandy
	Go, go, go, Jim Dandy, go, go, go, Jim Dandy

JINGLE BELL ROCK
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock, jingle bell swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun, now the jingle hop has begun.
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock, Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time.
Dancin' and prancin' in jingle bell square, in the frosty    air.
	What a bright time, it's the right time to rock the night away.
	Jingle bell time is a swell time to go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh.
Giddy-up, jingle-horse, pick up your feet, jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in a jinglin' beat, that's the jingle bell rock.
That's the jingle bell rock.

JINGLE BELLS
Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh, o'er the fields we go laughing all the way.
The bells on bob-tails ring to make our spirits bright.
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight.
	Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
	Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.
	Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
	Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.
A day or two ago I thought I'd take a ride, and soon Miss Fannie Bright as seated by my side.
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot,
He got into a drifted bank, and we, we got upsot.  (Jingle bells......)

JOHNNY, I HARDLY KNEW YA
With yer drums and guns and guns and drums, Ha-roo, Ha-roo,
With yer drums and guns and guns and drums, Ha -roo, Ha-roo,
With yer drums and guns and guns and drums, the enemy nearly slew ya;
Me darling dear, you look so queer, Johnny, I hard-ly knew ya.

Oh, where are your legs that used to run, Ha -roo, Ha-roo,
Oh, where are your legs that used to run, Ha -roo, Ha-roo,
Oh, where are your legs that used to run, when first you went to carry a gun?
Oh, I fear your dancing days are done, Johnny, I hardly knew ya.

You haven't an arm, and you haven't a leg, Ha -roo, Ha-roo,
You haven't an arm, and you haven't a leg, Ha -roo, Ha-roo,
You haven't an arm, and you haven't a leg, you're an eyeless, boneless, chickenless egg
You'll have to be put in a bowl to beg, Johnny, I hardly knew ya.

They're rolling out the guns again, Ha-roo, Ha-roo
They're rolling out the guns again, Ha-roo, Ha-roo
They're rolling out the guns again, but they'll never take our sons again
No, they'll never take our sons again, Johnny, I'm swearing to ya. (X2)

THE JOKER
There's always a Joker in the pack, there's always a cardboard clown
The poor, painted fool falls on his back, and everyone laughs when he's down
	There's always a funny man in the game, but he's only funny by mistake
	But everyone laughs at him, just the same, they don't see his painted heart break
They don't care, as long as there is a jester, just a fool, as foolish as he can be
There's always a Joker, that's a rule, but fate deals the hand and I see...the Joker is me
	There's always a funny man in the game, but he's only funny by mistake
	But everyone laughs at him, just the same, they don't see his painted heart break
They don't care, as long as there is a jester, just a fool, as foolish as he can be
There's always a Joker, that's a rule, but fate deals the hand and I see
The Joker is me, the Joker is me, the Joker is me

JOY TO THE WORLD
Joy to the world, the Lord is come, let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room, and Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing, and Heaven and Heaven and nature sing.
He rules the world with truth and grace, and makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness, and wonders of His love
And wonders of His love, and wonders, and wonders of His love.

JOY TO THE WORLD
Jeremiah was a bull frog, was a good friend of mine
I never understood a single word he said, but I helped him drink his wine
And he always had some mighty fine wine
	Singin' Joy to the World, all the boys and girls, now
	Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea, joy to you and me
If I were the king of the world, tell you what I'd do
I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the wars, make sweet love to you
	Singin' Joy to the World, all the boys and girls, now
	Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea, joy to you and me
You know I love the ladies, love to have my fun
I'm a high night flier and a rainbow rider-a straight-shootin' son of a gun
I said a straight-shootin' son of a gun
	Singin' Joy to the World, all the boys and girls, now
	Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea, joy to you and me
     Joy to the world, all the boys and girls, joy to the world, joy to you and me
            Joy to the World, all the boys and girls, now
	Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea, joy to you and me

JUANITA
Soft o'er the fountain, lingering falls the south-ern moon
Far o'er the mountain, breaks the day too soon
In thy dark eyes' splendor, where the warm light loves to dwell
Weary looks, yet tender, speak their fond farewell
Nita! Juanita! Ask thy soul if we should part
Nita! Juanita! Lean thou on my heart

When in thy dreaming, moons like these shall shine again
And daylight beaming, prove thy dreams are vain
Wilt thou not relenting, for thine absent lover sigh
In thy heart consenting to a prayer gone by?
Nita! Juanita! Let me linger by thy side
Nita! Juanita! Be my own fair bride

JUDY'S TURN TO CRY
	'Cause now, it's Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
	'Cause Johnny's come back (Johnny's come back, come back) to me
Oh, when Judy left with Johnny at my party (my party), and came back wearing his ring,
I sat down and cried my eyes out, now, that was a foolish thing
	'Cause now, it's Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
	'Cause Johnny's come back (Johnny's come back, come back) to me
Well, it hurt me so to see them dance together (together), I felt like making a scene
Then, my tears just fell like raindrops, 'cause Judy's smile was so mean
	But now, it's Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
	'Cause Johnny's come back (Johnny's come back, come back) to me
Oh, one night I saw them kissing at a party (a party), so, I kissed some other guy
Johnny jumped up and he hit him, 'cause he still loved me, that's why
	'So now, it's Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
	'Cause Johnny's come back (Johnny's come back, come back)
  	Yes, Johnny's come back (Johnny's come back, come back)
	Yes, Johnny's come back (Johnny's come back, come back) to me!

JULIANNE
The shady side of Sunny Mountain, that's the place it all began
There once lived the fairest maiden, and her name was Julianne
Julie's beau was tall and handsome, just a poor boy with treasures few
Still he promised rings of silver, for to prove his love was true
	Have you seen her in the moonlight, silver rings upon her hand
	Now she wears the crown of sorrow, and her name, and her name, was Julianne
Wake me early in the morning, 'ere the birds begin to sing
I'll get silver from the mountains, and I'll fashion thee a ring
Off he rode into the mountains, when the fields were damp with dew
But instead he rode around them, and a-courtin', and a-courtin' Jenny-Lou
	Chorus (Have you seen....)
The cabin door was standin' open on that wild and windy night
And the hound dog, he lay a-dyin' in that gloomy candle-light
They found her shattered, empty rifle, and the shawl she used to wear
But they never found his Julie, they never found, they never found the hungry bear
	Chorus

JUNE IN JANUARY
It's June in January, because I'm in love
It always is spring in my heart with you in my arms.
The snow is just white blossoms that fall from above.
And here is the reason, my dear, your magical charms.
       The night is cold, the trees are bare, but I can feel the scent of roses in the air.
It's June in January, because I'm in love
But only because I'm in love with you.  (repeat song)

JUNK
Motorcars, handlebars, bicycles for two, brokenhearted jubilee
Parachutes, army boots, sleeping bags for two, sentimental jamboree
Bye, bye says the sign in the shop window, why, why, says the junk in the yard
	Interlude
Candlesticks, building bricks, something old and new, memories for you and me
Bye, bye says the sign in the shop window, why, why, says the junk in the yard

JUST FRIENDS
Just friends, lovers no more, just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been, and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending.
Two friends, drifting apart, two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died
The story ends, and we're just friends
The story ends, and we're just friends.

JUST A GIGOLO
Just a gigolo, everywhere I go people know the part I'm playing
Paid for every dance, selling each romance, every night some heart  betraying
There will come a day youth will pass away, then what will they say about me?
When the end comes I know, they'll say just a gigolo as  life goes on without me.

JUST LIKE ROMEO AND JULIET
Findin' a job tomorrow mornin', got a little somethin' I wanna do.
Gonna buy  somethin' I could ride in, take my girl  datin' at the drive-in
Our love's gonna be written down in history, just like Romeo and Juliet.

I'm gonna buy her pretty presents, just like the ones in a catalog
Gonna show how much I love her, let her know one way or the oth-er
Our love's gonna be written down in history, just like Romeo and Juliet.
 Just like Romeo and Juliet, just like Romeo and Juliet  (X2)
	Talk about love and romance, just wait 'til I get myself straight.
	 I'm gonna put Romeo's fame right smack-dab on a date.
Ah, all right, now, I'm speculatin,' wonder what tomorrow's gonna really bring.
If I don't find work tomorrow, it's gonna be heartaches and sorrow.
Our love's gonna be destroyed like a tragedy, just like Romeo and Juliet.
Just like Romeo and Juliet, just like Romeo and Juliet

JUST A LITTLE
I can't stay, yes, I know, you know I hate to go.
But goodbye, love was sweet. Our worlds can never meet
	So I'll  cry just a little 'cause I love you so
	And I'll die just a little 'cause I have to go away
Can't you see how I feel, when I say love's unreal
So, goodbye, it's been sweet, even though incomplete
	So I'll  cry just a little 'cause I love you so
	And I'll die just a little 'cause I have to go away
Every night I still hear all your sighs very clear
Now love's gone, gone away, as I once heard you say
	Now I've cried just a little 'cause I love you so
	And I've died just a little 'cause I had to go away

JUST A LITTLE LOVIN'
Just a little lovin', early in the mornin', beats a cup of coffee for startin' off the day
Just a little lovin', when the world is dawnin',
Makes you wake up feelin' good things are comin' your way
This old world wouldn't be half as bad, it wouldn't be half as sad
If each and everybody in it had...
Just a little lovin', early in the mornin', a little extra somethin' to kind-a see them through
Nothin' turns the day on, and really gets it dawnin'
Like a little bit of lovin' from some lovin' someone like you

JUST A SONG BEFORE I GO
Just a song before I go, to whom it may concern
Traveling twice the speed of sound, it's easy to get burned
	When the shows were over, we had to get back home
	And when we opened up the door, I had to be alone
She helped me with my suitcase, she stands before my eyes
Driving me to the airport, and to the friendly skies
	Going through security, I held her for so long
	She finally looked at me in love, and she was gone
Just a song before I go, a lesson to be learned
Traveling twice the speed of sound, it's easy to get burned

JUST ONE LOOK
Just one look and I fell so hard in love with you oh, oh
I found out how good it feels to have your love, oh, oh
Say you will, will be mine forever and always, oh, oh
Just one look and I knew that you were my only one, oh, oh
	I thought I was dreamin', but I was wrong, yeah, yeah, yeah
	Uh but uh I'm gonna keep on schemin' till I can make you, make you my own
So you see I really care without you I'm nothing, oh, oh
Just one look and I know I'll get you someday, oh, oh
Just one look, that's all it took, just one look, that's all it took, just one look, that's all it took for me!

JUST ONE MORE CHANCE
Just one more chance, to prove it's you alone I care for
Each night I say a little prayer for just one more chance
Just one more night, to taste the kisses that enchant me
I'd want no others if you'd grant me just one more chance
	I've learned the meaning of repentance, now you're the jury at my trial
	I know that I should serve my sentence, still I'll be hoping all the while you'll give me
Just one more word, I said that I was glad to start out
But now I'm back to cry my heart out for just one more chance

JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS
	As  Dorothy Parker once said to her boyfriend, "Fare thee well,"
	As  Columbus announced when he knew he was bounced, "It was swell, Isabel, swell,"
	As Abelard said to Eloise,   "Don't forget  to drop a line to me, please,"
	As Juliet cried, in her Romeo's ear, "Romeo, why not face the fact, my dear?"
It was just one of those things, just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings, it was just one of those things
It was just one of those nights, just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon  on gossamer wings, just one of those things
	If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it, when we started painting the town
	We'd have been aware  that our love affair was too hot, not to cool down
So goodbye, dear, and Amen, here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun, but it was just  one  of those things

JUST TELL HER JIM SAID HELLO
She's sitting right over there. I'd know that face anywhere
I'd run up and embrace her, but I'm ashamed to face her
     Just tell her Jim said hello

I'd like to pour out my heart, but I don't know where to start
I'd like to tell her what I'm really feeling but
Just tell her Jim said hello
	Just tell her Jim said hello
	Just tell her Jim and she'll know
Don't tell her I'm feeling blue. That's just between me and you
Don't say I'm thinking of her, don't tell her I still love her. Just tell her Jim said hello.
     Just tell her Jim said hello, Just tell her Jim said hello

Don't say I'm thinking of her, don't tell her I still love her. Just tell her Jim said hello.
     Just tell her Jim said hello, Just tell her Jim said hello

JUST THE TWO OF US
I see the crystal rain drops fall, and the beauty of it all is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind, when I think of you sometime,
And I want to spend some time with you.
     Just the two of us, we can make it if we try, just the two of us, (just the two of us.)
     Just the two of us, building castles in the sky, just the two of us, you and I.
We look for love, no time for tears, wasted water's all that is, and it don't make no flowers grow.
Good things might come to those who wait, but not for those who wait too late
We've got to go for all we know.
     Just the two of us, we can make it if we try, just the two of us, (just the two of us.)
     Just the two of us, building castles in the sky, just the two of us, you and I.
I hear the crystal raindrops fall on the window down the hall, and it becomes the mornin' dew.
And, darlin', when the mornin' comes, and I see the mornin' sun, I want to be the one with you.
	Just the two of us, we can make it if we try, just the two of us, (just the two of us.)
	Just the two of us, building big castles way on high, just the two of us, you and I

JUST WALKIN' IN THE RAIN
Just walkin' in the rain, gettin' soakin' wet, torturin' my heart by trying to forget
Just walkin' in the rain, so alone and blue, all because my heart still remembers you
	People come to windows, they all stare at me
	Shake their heads in sorrow, sayin', "Who can that fool be?"
Just walkin' in the rain, thinkin' how we met,
Knowin' things have changed, somehow I can't forget
	People come to windows, they all stare at me
	Shake their heads in sorrow, sayin', "Who can that fool be?"
Just walkin' in the rain, thinkin' how we met,
Knowin' things have changed, somehow I can't forget

KANSAS CITY
Goin' to Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come
Goin' to Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come
They got some crazy little women there, and I'm gonna get me one

I'm gonna be standin' on the corner, 12th Street and Vine
I'm gonna be standin' on the corner, 12th Street and Vine
With my Kansas City baby, and a bottle of Kansas City wine
	Well, I might take a train, I might take a plane,
	But if I have to walk, I'm goin' just the same
Goin' to Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come
They got some crazy little women there, and I'm gonna get me one
　　　　Now if I stay with that woman, I know I'm gonna die
　　　　Gotta find a brand new baby, that's the reason why...
Goin' to Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come
They got some crazy little women there, and I'm gonna get me one
They got some crazy little women there, and I'm gonna get me one

KEEP YOUR SUNNY SIDE UP
Keep your sunny side up, up, hide the side that gets blue.
If you have nine sons in a row, baseball teams make money, you know!
Keep your funny side up, up, let your laughter come through, do!
Stand up on your legs, be like two fried eggs,  keep your sunny side up!
	Life can be a pleasure or a pain, good or bad, successful or in vain;
	Happiness is just a point of view, if you have it here's the thing to do;
Keep your sunny side up, up, drown a frown with a smile.
If you think it's raining for you, just remember, others are blue.
Always look for the bright side, start the day on the right side;
You'll find life worthwhile, learn to wear a smile, keep your sunny side up!

KENTUCKY WOMAN
Kentucky Woman, she shines with her own kind of light
She'd look at you once, and a day that's all wrong looks all right
And I love her, God knows, I love her
	Kentucky Woman, if she get to know you, she goin' to own you, Kentucky Woman
Well, she ain't the kind makes heads turn at the drop of her name
But something inside, that she's got, turns you on just the same
And she loves me, God knows, she loves me
	Kentucky Woman, if she get to know you, she goin' to own you, Kentucky Woman
I don't want much, the good Lord's earth beneath my feet
A gentle touch from that one girl, and life is sweet and good
Ain't no doubt, I'm talkin' about ....
	Kentucky Woman, if she get to know you, she goin' to own you, Kentucky Woman
I don't want much, the good Lord's earth beneath my feet
A gentle touch from that one girl, and life is sweet and good
Ain't no doubt, I'm talkin' about ....
	Kentucky Woman, if she get to know you, she goin' to own you, Kentucky Woman
 	Kentucky Woman, Kentucky Woman

KEY LARGO
Wrapped around each other, trying so hard to stay warm
That first cold winter together, lying in each other's arms
Watching those old movies, falling in love so desperately
Honey, I was your hero, and you were my leading lady.
	We had it all, just like Bogie and Bacall
	Starring in our own late, late show, sailing away to Key Largo
	Here's lookin' at you, kid, missin' all the things we did
	We can find it once again, I know, just like they did in Key Largo
Honey, can't you remember, we played all the parts
That sweet scene of surrender when you gave me your heart
Please say you will play it again, 'cause I love you still. Baby this can't be the end.
	We had it all, just like Bogie and Bacall
	Starring in our own late, late show, sailing away to Key Largo
	Here's lookin' at you, kid, missin' all the things we did
	We can find it once again, I know, just like we did in Key Largo

KILLING ME SOFTLY
	Strummin' my pain with his fingers, singin' my life with his words
	Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly with his song,
	Tellin' my whole life with his words, killing me softly with his song.
I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style.
And so, I came to see him, and listen for a while.
And there he was, this young boy, a stranger to my eyes
	Strummin' my pain with his fingers, singin' my life with his words
	Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly with his song,
	Tellin' my whole life with his words, killing me softly with his song.
I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters, and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on
	Strummin' my pain with his fingers, singin' my life with his words
	Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly with his song,
	Tellin' my whole life with his words, killing me softly with his song.
He sang as if he knew me, in all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me, as if I wasn't there
He just kept right on, singin' clear and strong
	Strummin' my pain with his fingers, singin' my life with his words
	Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly with his song,
	Tellin' my whole life with his words, killing me softly with his song.

KIND OF A DRAG
Kind of a drag, when your baby don't love you
Kind of a drag, when you know she's been untrue
	Oh, listen to what I've got to say
	Girl, I still love you, I'll always love you, anyway, anyway, anyway
Kind of a drag, when your baby says goodbye
Kind of a drag, when you feel like you wanna cry
	Oh, girl, even though you made me feel blue
	I still love you, I'll always love you, anyway, anyway, anyway
	Oh, listen to what I've got to say
	Girl, I still love you, I'll always love you, anyway, anyway, anyway

KING OF THE ROAD
Trailer for sale or rent, rooms to let, fifty cents.
No phone, no pool, no pets, I ain't got no cigarettes
Ah, but two hours of pushin' broom buys an eight-by-twelve four-bit room
	I'm a man of means, by no means, King of the Road
Third box car midnight train, destination Bangor, Maine
Old worn out suit and shoes, I don't pay no union dues
I smoke old stogies I have found, short, but not too big around
	I'm a man of means, by no means, King of the Road
I know every engineer on every train, all of the children, and all of their names
And every handout in every town, and every lock that ain't locked when no one's around
   (repeat first verse)

KISSES SWEETER THAN WINE
Well, when I was a young man; never been kissed, I got to thinkin' it over how much I had missed.
So I got me a girl and I kissed her and then, and then, oh, Lordy, well, I kissed her again, because
	She had kisses sweeter than wine, She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine.
Well, I asked her to marry and to be my sweet wife, I told her we'd be so happy for the rest of our life.
I begged and I pleaded like a natural man, and then,      oh Lordy, well she gave me her hand, because
	 She had kisses sweeter than wine, She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine.
Well, we worked very hard; both me and my wife, workin' hand-in-hand to have a good life.
We had corn in the field and wheat in the bin, and then,       oh Lord, I was the father of twins, because
	 She had kisses sweeter than wine, She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine.
Well, our children they numbered just about four, and they all had a sweetheart a-knockin' at the door.
They all got married and they didn't hesitate, I was,    oh Lord, the grand-father of eight, because
	 She had kisses sweeter than wine, She had,      mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine.
Well, now that I'm old and I'm a'ready to go, I get to thinkin' what happened, a long time ago.
Had a lot of kids, a lot of trouble and pain, but then,       oh Lordy, well, I'd do it all again, because
	 She had kisses sweeter than wine, She had,      mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine!

A KISS TO BUILD A DREAM ON
Give me a kiss to build a dream on, and my imagination will thrive upon that kiss
Sweetheart, I ask no more than this, a kiss to build a dream on.
Give me a kiss before you leave me, and my imagination will feed my hungry heart
Leave me one thing before we part, a kiss to build a dream on
	When I'm alone with my fancies I'll be with you
	Weaving romances, making believe they're true
Give me your lips for just a moment, and my imagination will make that moment live
Give me what you alone can give, a kiss to build a dream on.

KNOCK ON WOOD
I don't wanna lose this good thing....that I've got. If I do, I will surely....surely lose a lot.
'Cause our love is better....than any love I've known.
     It's like thunder, lightnin', the way you love me is frightenin'. I better knock......on wood, baby

	I better knock......on wood, baby. I better knock
Oh, yeah, think I better knock on wood
Think I better knock  on wood, think I better knock on wood

KODACHROME
When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school, it's a wonder I can think at all
And, though my lack of education hasn't hurt me none, I can read the writing on the wall
     Kodachrome, they give us those nice bright colors, they give us the greens of summers
     Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
     I got a Nikon camera, I love to take a photograph, so mama, don't take my Kodachrome away
If you took all the girls I knew when I was single, and brought them all together for one night
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination. Everything looks worse in black and white
     Kodachrome, they give us those nice bright colors, they give us the greens of summers
     Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
     I got a Nikon camera, I love to take a photograph, so mama, don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome away  (X3)

Mama, don't take my Kodachrome, Mama, don't take my Kodachrome
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome, leave your boy so far from home
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome, ooo..............
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome away

KOMM, GIB MIR DEINE HAND
O, komm doch, komm zu mir, du nimmst mir den Verstand, O, komm doch, komm zu mir
 Komm, gib mir deine Hand, komm, gib mir deine Hand, komm, gib mir deine Hand

O, du bist so schön, schön wie ein Diamant, ich will mit dir gehen
Komm, gib mir deine Hand, komm, gib mir deine Hand, komm, gib mir deine Hand
              In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh, das war noch nie bei einer anderen
              Einmal so, einmal so, einmal so
O, komm doch, komm zu mir, du nimmst mir den Verstand, O, komm doch, komm zu mir

THE GOOD LIFE/LA BELLE VIE
Oh, the good life, full of fun seems to be the ideal
Mm, the good life lets you hide all the sadness you feel
You won't really fall in love, for you can't take the chance
So, please be honest with yourself, don't try to fake romance

It's the good life, to be free and explore the unknown
Like the heartaches, when you learn you must face them alone
Please remember, I still want you, and, in case you wonder why
Well, just wake up, kiss the good life goodbye.

O, la belle vie, sans amour, sans soucis, sans problème
Mmm la belle vie, on est seul, on est libre, et l'on s'aime
On s'amuse à passer avec tous ses copains
Des nuits blanches qui se penchant sur les petits matins

Mais la belle vie, sans amour, sans soucis, sans problème
Oui, la belle vie, on s'enlace, on est triste, et l'on traine
Alors pense que moi je t'aime, et quand tu auras compris
Réveille-toi, je serai là pour toi

Please remember, I still want you, and, in case you wonder why
Well, just wake up, kiss the good life goodbye.

LADY BE GOOD
	Listen to my tale of woe; it's terribly sad, but true
	All dressed up, no place to go; each evening I'm awfully blue
	I must win some winsome miss, can't go on like this
	I could blossom out, I know, with somebody just like you, so....
Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good! Oh, lady be good to me
I am so awfully misunderstood, so, lady be good to me.
Oh, please have some pity, I'm all alone in this big city, I tell you
I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, so lady, be good,
Lady, be good, lady, be good to me............to me................
To me..........to me!

LADY GODIVA
Seventeen, a beauty queen, she made a ride that caused a scene in the town
Her long, blonde hair, hangin' down around her knees,
All the cats who dig striptease, prayin' for a little breeze
	Her long blonde hair, falling down around her arms,
	Hiding all the lady's charms....Lady Godiva
She found fame, and made her name, a Hollywood director came into town,
And said to her, "How'd you like to be a star?
You're a girl who could go far, especially dressed the way you are."
	She smiled at him, gave her pretty head a shake
	That was Lady G's mistake, a-hey-hey-hey....Lady Godiva
He directs "Certificate X," and people now are craning their necks to see her
'Cause she's a star, one that everybody knows,
Finished with the striptease shows, now she can afford her clothes
	Her long blonde hair, lyin' on the barber's floor
	Doesn't need it long anymore....Lady Godiva

THE LADY IS A TRAMP
She gets too hungry for dinner at eight, she likes the theatre and never comes late
She never bothers with people she'd hate, that's why the lady is a tramp

Doesn't like crap games with barons or earls, won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls, that's why the lady is a tramp
	She likes the free fresh wind in her hair, life without care, she's broke and it's oke
	Hates California, it's cold and it's damp, that's why the lady is a tramp
She gets too hungry to wait for dinner at eight, she loves the theatre but never comes late
She'd never bother with people she'd hate, that's why the lady is a tramp

She'll have no crap games with sharpies and frauds,
And she won't go to Harlem in Lincolns or Fords
And she won't dish the dirt with the rest of the broads, that's why the lady is a tramp
	She loves the free fresh wind in her hair, life without care, she's broke, but it's oke
	Hates California, it's so cold and so damp,
	That's why the lady... that's why the lady...that's why the lady is a tramp

LADY MADONNA
Lady Ma-donna, children at your feet. Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money when you pay the rent? Did you think that money was hea-ven sent?
	Friday night arrives without a suitcase. Sunday morning creeping like a nun.
	Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace. See how they run.
Lady Ma-donna, baby at your breast. Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.
       Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba............       See how they run.
Lady Ma-donna, lying on your bed, listen to the music playing in your head.
	Tuesday afternoon is never ending, Wednesday morning papers didn't come.
	Thursday night your stockings needed mending. See  how they run.
Lady Ma-donna, children at your feet. Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.

LAST NIGHT I DIDN'T GET TO SLEEP AT ALL
Last night I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no
I lay awake and watched until the morning light, washed away the darkness of the lonely night

Oh, and last night I got to thinking' maybe I, I, I,
Should call you up and just for-get my foolish pride
I heard your number ringing', I went cold inside, and last  night I didn't get to sleep at all
   	I know it's not my fault, I did my best. God knows this heart of mine could use a rest
   	But more and more I find the dreams I left behind are somehow too real to re-place
Oh, last night I didn't get to sleep at all, no no
The sleeping pill I took was just a waste of time
I couldn't close my eyes 'cause you were on my mind
And last night I didn't get to sleep, didn't get to sleep, no I didn't get to sleep at all,
  No, no no......no, no no,

LAST NIGHT I HAD THE STRANGEST DREAM
Last night I had the strangest dream I ever dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war
	I dreamed I saw a mighty room, and the room was filled with men
	And the paper they were signing said they'd never fight again
And when the papers all were signed, and a million copies made
They all joined hands and bowed their heads, and grateful prayers were prayed
	And the people in the streets below were dancing 'round and 'round
	While swords and guns and uniforms were scattered on the ground
Last night I had the strangest dream I ever dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war
I dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war

THE LAST TIME I SAW PARIS
A lady known as Paris, romantic and charming,
Has left her old companions, and faded from view
Lonely men with lonely eyes are seeking her in vain
Her streets are where they were, but there's no sign of her, she has left the Seine

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
I heard the laughter of her heart in every street café
The last time I saw Paris, her trees were dressed for spring,
And lovers walked beneath those trees, and birds found songs to sing
	I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years
	The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears
The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
No matter how they change her, I'll remember her that way

THE LATE, LATE SHOW
Gee it's cozy in the park tonight, when you cuddle up and hold me tight
Stars above, they seem to know, we're puttin' on the late late show

Hear the crazy music in the trees, see the flowers dancin' in the breeze
Old man moon begins to glow, he's joinin' in the late late show
	Birds that should be dreamin' start in chirpin' a song
	While fireflies are gleamin', we kiss, kiss, all night long
Then we amble back to your front door, say goodnight and then we kiss some more
Guess you know I like you so, it started on the late late show
Guess you know I like you so, it started on the late late show!

LATELY
Lately, I have had the strangest feeling, with no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume, with, you say, no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon, you don't know, never know
Well, I'm a man of many wishes, hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel,  my eyes won't let me hide, 'cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lately I've been staring in the mirror, very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason, with your heart
Just the other night while you were sleeping, I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping. you just say, nothing's changed
Well, I'm a man of many wishes, hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel,  my eyes won't let me hide, 'cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes, I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide, 'cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, yes, this time could mean goodbye.

LAUGH, LAUGH
I hate to say it but I told you so, don't mind my preachin' to you
I said "don't trust 'em, baby" now you know
You don't know everything there is to know in school.

Wouldn't believe me when I gave advice, I said that he was a tease
If you want help, you better ask me now
So be sincere, convince me with a "pretty please"
     Laugh, laugh, I thought I'd die, it seemed so funny to me
     Laugh, laugh, you met a guy who taught you how it feels to be lonely, oh so lonely
Don't think I'm bein' funny when I say, "You got just what you deserve!"
I can't help feeling you found out today
You thought you were too good, you had a lot of nerve

Won't say I'm sorry for the things I said. I'm glad he packed up to go
You kept on braggin' he was yours instead
Found you don't know ev'rything there is to know
     Laugh, laugh, I thought I'd die, it seemed so funny to me
     Laugh, laugh, you met a guy who taught you how it feels to be lonely, oh so lonely
Before I go I got to say one thing, don't close your ears to me
Take my advice and you find out that he Is just another guy who'll cause you misery

Don't say you can't get any boy to call, don't be so smug, or else
You'll find you can't get any boy at all, you'll wind up an old lady sittin' on the shelf.
     Laugh, laugh, I thought I'd die, it seemed so funny to me
     Laugh, laugh, you met a guy who taught you how it feels to be
     Lonely, oh so lonely, lonely, oh so lonely

LAUGHTER IN THE RAIN
Strolling along country roads with my baby, it starts to rain, it begins to pour
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin, I feel a shiver run up my spine
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine
	Oo, I hear laughter in the rain, walking hand in hand with the one I love
	Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside
After a while we run under a tree, I turn to her and she kisses me
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves, softly she breathes and I close my eyes
Sharing our love under stormy skies
	Oo, I hear laughter in the rain, walking hand in hand with the one I love
	Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside

LAURA
You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well.
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well.

Laura is the face in the misty light,
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall.
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through.
Those eyes, how familiar they seem.
She gave your very first kiss to you.
That was Laura but she's only a dream.

LAVENDER BLUE
Lavender blue, dilly, dilly, lavender green. If I were king, dilly, dilly, I'd need a queen
Who told me so, dilly, dilly, who told me so? I told myself, dilly, dilly, I told me so
	If your dilly, dilly heart feels a dilly, dilly way, and, if you answer, yes.
	In a pretty little church, on a dilly, dilly day, you'll be wed in a dilly, dilly dress
Lavender blue, dilly, dilly, lavender green, then I'll be king, dilly, dilly, and you'll be my queen
     Great-grandfather met great-grandmother when she was a shy young miss
     And great-grandfather won great-grandmother with words more or less like this:
Lavender blue, dilly, dilly, lavender green. If you were king, dilly, dilly, you'd need a queen
Who told you so, dilly, dilly, who told you so? I told myself, dilly, dilly, I told me so
	If your dilly, dilly heart feels a dilly, dilly way, and, if you answer, yes.
	In a pretty little church, on a dilly, dilly day, you'll be wed in a dilly, dilly dress of
Lavender blue, dilly, dilly, lavender green, then I'll be king, dilly, dilly, and you'll be my queen

LA VIE EN ROSE
Hold me close and hold me fast the magic spells you cast, this is  La Vie En Rose
When you kiss me heaven sighs, and though I close my eyes,  I see La Vie En Rose
When you press me to your heart I'm in a world apart, a world where roses bloom
And when you speak angels sing from above, everyday words seem to turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me and life will always be La Vie En Rose.

Quand elle me prend dans ses bras, elle me parle tout bas, je vois la vie en rose
Elle me dit des mots d'amour, des mots de tous les jours, et ça me fait quelque chose
Elle est entrée dans mon coeur, une part de bonheur, dont je connais la cause.
C'est elle pour moi, moi pour elle dans la vie, elle me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vie
Et des que je l'apercois, alors je sens en moi mon coeur qui bat.

LAWS OF NATURE
I get my energy from the sun, I'm not the only one
I feel better when I'm done. I get my energy from the sun

I get my oxygen from the air, there's plenty for me, and plenty to spare
And I can find it anywhere, I get my oxygen from the air
	I plant my seeds in the howling gale, but the laws of nature still prevail
	Look at the season, look at me, the apple didn't fall far from the tree
I get my water from the rain, if it don't rain I'll die
Stormy weather saves my life. Sometimes I laugh, and wonder why

I get my energy from the sun, I'm not the only one
And I feel better when I'm done. I get my energy from the sun
And I feel better when I'm done. I get my energy from the sun

LAZY
	Every time I see a puppy upon a summer's day,
	A puppy dog at play, my heart is filled with envy
	That's why I'm in such a hurry to pass the time away
	Like the pup, I'm all fed up, and though it's wrong to be, I long to be...
Lazy,  I want to be lazy, I'm longing to lay in the sun with no work to be done
Under that awning they call the sky
Stretching and yawning, and let the world go drifting by.
	I wanna peep through the deep, tangled wildwood
	Counting sheep 'til I sleep like a child would
With a great big valise full of books to read, where it's peaceful
    While I'm killing time being lazy.

LAZY BONES
Lazy Bones, sleepin' in the sun, how d'you expect to get your day's work done?
You'll never get your day's work done, lyin' in the noon day sun
Lazy Bones, sleepin' in the shade, how're you gonna get your cornmeal made?
You'll never get your cornmeal made, lyin' in that noon day shade
	When the taters need sprayin', I bet you keep prayin' the bugs fall off of the vine
	And when you go fishin' I bet you keep wishin' the fish don't grab at your line
Lazy Bones, loafin' through the day, how d'you expect to make a dime that way?
You'll never make a dime that way. You never hear a word I say.

	When the taters need sprayin', I bet you keep prayin' the bugs fall off of the vine
	And when you go fishin' I bet you keep wishin' the fish don't grab at your line
Lazy Bones, loafin' through the day, how d'you expect to make a dime that way?
You'll never make a dime that way. You never heard a word I say.

LAZY MOON
Lazy moon, come out soon, make my poor heart beat warmer
Light the way, bright as day, for my sweet little charmer

She's to meet me in the lane tonight, if the sky is bright and clear
Oh moon, don't keep me waiting here tonight
Watching and waiting, heart a-palpitating, longing for my lady love so dear.
Lazy moon, lazy moon, why don't you show your face above the hill

Lazy moon, come out soon, you can make me happy, if you will
Now, when my lady sees your face a-peepin',
That's when I know her promise she'll be keepin'
Tell me, what's the matter, are you sleepin'? Lazy moon.

LAZY RIVER
Up a lazy river by the old mill-run, that lazy, lazy river in the noonday sun.
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree; throw away your troubles, dream a dream with me
Up a lazy river where the robin's song awakes a bright new morning, we can loaf along.
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love; up a lazy river, how happy you can be,
Up a lazy river, without a paddle, up........ a lazy river.......... with me

LEADER OF THE BAND
An only child, alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work and his heart was known to none.
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay
A quiet man of music, denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand
  chorus: The leader of the band is tired, and his eyes are growing old
	    But his blood runs through my instrument, and his song is in my soul
	    My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
	    I'm just a living  legacy to the leader of the band
My brothers' lives were different, for they heard another call
One went to Chicago, and the other to St. Paul
And I'm in Colorado, when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose, and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said "I love you" near enough.
    chorus

LEAN ON ME
	Sometimes in our lives we all have pain, we all have sorrow.
	But if we are wise, we know that there's always tomorrow.
Lean on me when you're not strong, I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on.

Please swallow your pride, if I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs that you won't let show.
	You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand, we all need somebody to lean on.
	I just might have a problem that you'll understand, we all need somebody to lean on.
Lean on me when you're not strong, I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on.
	You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand, we all need somebody to lean on.
	I just might have a problem that you'll understand, we all need somebody to lean on.
If there is a load you have to bear, that you can't carry
I'm right up the road, I'll share your load, if you just call me.
     (Call me) if you need a friend  (Call me)  call me, uh-huh
     (Call me) when you need a friend  (Call me) if you ever need a friend
     (Call me) call me (Call me) call me (Call me) call me

LEARNIN' THE BLUES
The tables are empty, the dance floor's deserted
You play the same love song, it's the tenth time you've heard it
That's the beginning, just one of the clues
You've had your first lesson in learnin' the blues

The cigarettes you light, one after another
Won't help you forget her, and the way that you love her
You're only burning a torch you can't lose
But you're on the right track for learnin' the blues
	When you're at home alone, the blues will taunt you constantly
	When you're out in a crowd, the blues will haunt your memory
The nights when you don't sleep,  the whole night you're crying
But you can't forget her, soon you even stop trying
You'll walk the floor, and wear out your shoes
When you feel your heart break, you're learnin' the blues

LEAVIN' ON A JET PLANE
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go, I'm standing here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn', taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn.
Already I'm so lonesome I could cry.
     So kiss me and smile for me, tell me that you'll wait for me
     Hold me like you'll never let me go
     'Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane, don't know when I'll be back again
     Oh, babe, I hate to go.
There's so many times I've let you down, so many times I've played around
I tell you now... they don't mean a thing
Every place I go I'll think of you, every song I sing I'll sing for you
When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring......CHORUS

Now the time has come to leave you, one more time, let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come, when I won't have to leave alone
About the times I won't have to say.....CHORUS

LE JOUR OU LA PLUIE VIENDRA
The day that the rains came down, Mother Earth smiled again
Now the lilacs could bloom, now the fields could grow greener
The day that the rains came down, buds were born, love was born
As the young buds will grow, so our young love will grow. Love, sweet love.
	A robin sang a song of love, a willow tree reached up to the heavens
	As if to thank the sky above, for all that rain, that welcome rain
	We looked across the meadowland, and seemed to sense a kind of miracle
	Much too deep to understand, and there we were, so much in love
The day that the rains came down, mountain streams swelled with pride
Gone the dry river bed, gone the dust from the valley
The day that the rains came down, buds were born, love was born
As the young buds will grow, so our young love will grow. Love, sweet love, love, sweet love.

Le jour où la pluie viendra, nous serons, toi et moi
Les plus riches du monde, les plus riches du monde
Les arbres, pleurant de joie, offriront dans leurs bras
Les plus beaux fruits du monde, les plus beaux fruits du monde, ce jour-là
	La triste, triste terre rouge, qui craque, craque à l'infini
	Les branches nues que rien ne bouge, se gorgeront de pluie, de pluie
	Et le blé roulera par vagues au fond de greniers endormis
	Et je t'enroulerai de bagues, et de colliers jolis, jolis
Le jour où la pluie viendra, nous serons, toi et moi
Les fiancés du monde, les plus riches du monde
Les arbres, pleurant de joie, offriront dans leurs bras
Les plus beaux fruits du monde, les plus beaux fruits du monde, ce jour-là, ce jour-là

LEMON TREE
When I was just a lad of ten, my father said to me,
"Come here and take a lesson from the lovely lemon tree."
"Don't put your faith in love, my boy", my father said to me,
"I fear you'll find that love is like the lovely lemon tree."
	Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
	But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.
	Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
	But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.
One day beneath the lemon tree, my love and I did lie
A girl so sweet that when she smiled the stars rose in the sky.
We passed that summer lost in love beneath the lemon tree
The music of her laughter hid my father's words from me:
               CHORUS
One day she left without a word. She took away the sun.
And in the dark she left behind, I knew what she had done.
She'd left me for another, it's a common tale but true.
A sadder man but wiser now I sing these words to you:
	   CHORUS

LEROY BROWN
Well, the south side of Chicago is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there you better just beware of a man named Leroy Brown
Now, Leroy wanted trouble, you see, he stands about 6 foot 4
All the downtown ladies call him "Treetop Lover," all the mans just call him "Sir!"

	Well he's bad, bad Leroy Brown, baddest man in that whole damned town
	He was badder than Old King Kong, and meaner than the junkyard dog.

Now Leroy, he's a gambler, and he like his fancy clothes
And he like to wave a dozen diamond rings in front of everybody's nose.
He got a custom Continental, he got an Eldorado too
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun, he got a razor in his shoe.

Well Friday, 'bout a week ago, Leroy, shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar sat a girl named Doris, and ooo, that girl looked nice!
Well, he cast his eyes upon her, and then the trouble soon began
Ol' Leroy Brown learned his lesson 'bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man.

	Well he's bad, bad Leroy Brown, baddest man in that whole damned town
	He was badder than Old King Kong, and meaner than the junkyard dog.

Well, the two men took to fightin', and when they pulled them from the floor
Ol' Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle, with a couple of pieces gone.

	Well he's bad, bad Leroy Brown, baddest man in that whole damned town
	He was badder than Old King Kong, and meaner than the junkyard dog.
	Well, he was badder than Old King Kong, and meaner than the junkyard dog.

LES BICYCLETTES DE BELSIZE
Turning and turning, the world goes on. We can't change it, my friend
Let us go riding now through the days, together to the end, 'til the end
	Les bicyclettes de Belsize, carry us side by side
	And, hand in hand, we will ride over Belsize
	Turn your magical eyes 'round and around, looking at all we've found
	Carry us through the skies, les bicyclettes de Belsize
Spinning and spinning,  the dreams I know, rolling on through my head
Let us enjoy them before they go, come the dawn, they all are dead, yes, they're dead
	Les bicyclettes de Belsize, carry us side by side
	And, hand in hand, we will ride over Belsize
	Turn your magical eyes 'round and around, looking at all we've found
	Carry us through the skies, les bicyclettes de Belsize

LET IT BE
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary Comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, Let it Be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, Let it Be
	Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeh, let it be,  whisper words of wisdom, Let It Be
And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.
	Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeh, let it be,  there will be an answer, Let It Be
And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
	Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeh, let it be, whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

LET IT BE ME
I bless the day I found you, I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me
Don't take this heaven from one, if you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me
	Each time we meet, love, I find complete love
	Without your sweet love, what would life be
So never leave me lonely, tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me

LET IT SNOW!  LET IT SNOW!  LET IT SNOW!
Oh the weather outside is frightful, but the fire is so delightful.
And since we've no place to go, Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping and I brought some corn for popping,
The lights are turned way down low, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
	When we finally kiss goodnight, how I'll hate going out in the storm
	But if you'll really hold me tight, all the way home I'll be warm.
The fire is slowly dying, and my dear, we're still goodbye-ing
But as long as you love me so, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

LET ME BE THE ONE
Some sleepless night if you should find yourself alone
	Let me be the one you run to, let me be the one you come to
	When you need someone to turn to, let me be the one
To set things right when this whole world's turned upside down
	Let me be the one..................
For love and understanding, to find a quiet place, for silent understanding, a loving touch
Come to me when things go wrong, and there's no love to light the way
	Let me be the one you run to, let me be the one you come to
	When you need someone to turn to, let me be the one

LET ME CALL YOU SWEETHEART
Let me call you sweetheart, I'm in love with you
Let me hear you whisper that you love me too
Keep the lovelight glowing in your eyes so true
Let me call you sweetheart, I'm in love with you.

LET ME GO, LOVER
Oh, let me go, let me go, let me go, lover. Let me be, set me free from your spell
You made me weak, cut me deep, I can't sleep, lover
I was cursed from the first day I fell
	You don't want me, but you want me to go on wanting you
	How I pray that you will say that we're through
Please turn me loose, what's the use, let me go, lover, let me go, let me go, let me go
	You don't want me, but you want me to go on wanting you
	How I pray that you will say that we're through
Please turn me loose, what's the use, let me go, lover, let me go, let me go, let me go

LET ME IN
	Let me in whee-ooh (whee-ooh, whee-ooh, hoop-whee-ooh)
	(Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, hoo-ooh-oop-whee-ooh, whee-ooh)
I can see the dancin', the silhouettes on the shade. I hear the music, all the lovers on parade
Open up, I want to come in again, I thought you were my friend
	Pitter patter of those fee-ee-ee-ee-eet, movin' and a-groovin' with that be-eat
	Jumpin' and stompin on the flo-o-o-o-oor.  Let me in! Open up!
	Why don't you open up that door?
I hear music let me in, I want to come in again
Let me in, a-well I heard it just then, I thought you were my friend
		(Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, hoop-whee-ooh)
		(Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, hoo-ooh-oop-whee-ooh, whee-ooh)
	Pitter patter of those fee-ee-ee-ee-eet, movin' and a-groovin' with that be-eat
	Jumpin' and stompin on the flo-o-o-o-oor.  Let me in! Open up!
	Why don't you open up that door?
I hear music, let me in, oh, I heard it just then
Let me in, I want to come in again, I thought you were my friend
		(Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, hoop-whee-ooh)
		(Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, hoo-ooh-oop-whee-ooh, whee-ooh)

LET MY PEOPLE GO
When Israel was in Egypt land, Let my people go!
Oppressed so hard, they could not stand, Let my people go!
	   Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land
	   Tell old Pharaoh, Let my people go!
Thus saith the Lord, bold Moses said, Let my people go!
If not I'll smite your firstborn dead, Let my people go!
	   Go down, Moses...
As Israel stood by the water side,  Let my people go!
By God's com-mand it did divide, Let my people go!
	   Go down, Moses...

LET'S CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF
	Things have come to a pretty pass, our romance is growing flat,
	'Cause you like this and the other, while I go for this and that.
	Goodness knows what the end will be, oh I don't know where I'm at
	It's plain to see we two will never make one, something must be done.
You say eether and I say eyether, you say neether and I say nyther
Eether, eyether, neether, nyther, let's call the whole thing off.
You like potato and I like potahto, you like tomato and I like tomahto,
Potato, potahto, tomato, tomahto, let's call the whole thing off.
	But oh! If we call the whole thing off, then we must part
	And oh! If we ever part, then that might break my heart!
So, if you like pajamas, and I like pajahmas, I'll wear pajamas and give up pajahmas
For we know we need each other, so  we better call the calling off off
Let's call the whole thing off!

You say laughter and I say lawfter, you say after and I say awfter
Laughter, lawfter, after, awfter, let's call the whole thing off
You like Havana and I like Havahna, you bananas and I like banahnas
Havana, Havahna, banana, banahna, let's call the whole thing off.
	But oh! If we call the whole thing off, then we must part
	And oh! If we ever part, then that might break my heart!
So, if you go for oysters and I go for ersters, I'll order and cancel the ersters
For we know we need each other, so  we better call the calling off off
Let's call the whole thing off!

LET'S DO IT, LET'S FALL IN LOVE
Birds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas do it, let's do it, let's fall in love.
In Spain the best upper sets do it, Lithuanians and Letts do it, let's do it, let's fall in love
The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it, not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it, think of Siamese twins.
Some Argentines without means do it, people say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

LET'S FACE THE MUSIC AND DANCE
There may be trouble ahead, but while there's moonlight and music and love and romance,
Let's face the music, and dance
Before the fiddlers have fled, before they ask us to pay the bill, and while we still have the chance,
Let's face the music, and dance
	Soon we'll be without the moon, humming a different tune, and then....
There may be teardrops to shed, so while there's moonlight and music and love and romance,
Let's face the music, and dance. Let's face the music, and dance.

LET'S FALL IN LOVE
	I have a feelin', it's a feelin' I'm concealin', I don't know why
	It's just a mental, incidental, sentimental, alibi
	But I adore you, so strong for you, why go on stallin'?
	I'm fallin', love is callin', why be shy?
Let's fall in love, why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it, let's take a chance. Why be afraid of it?
Let's close our eyes, and make our own paradise
Little we know of it, still we can try to make a go of it
We might have been meant for each other. To be or not to be, let our hearts discover
Let's fall in love, why shouldn't we fall in love? Now is the time for it, while we are young
Let's fall in love, let's fall in love, let's fall in love

LET'S GET AWAY FROM IT ALL
Let's take a boat to Bermuda. Let's take a plane to Saint Paul
Let's take a kayak to Quincy or Nyack, let's get away from it all
Let's take a trip in a trailer, no need to come back at all
Let's take a powder to Boston for chowder, let's get away from it all
We'll travel 'round from town to town, we'll visit every state
I'll repeat "I love you, Sweet" in all the forty-eight
Let's go again to Niagara, this time we'll look at the "Fall."
Let's leave our hut, dear, get out of the rut, dear.
Let's get away from it all.

LET'S HANG ON
　　　　There ain't no good in our goodbye-in', true love takes a lot of tryin'...oooh I'm cryin'

To take each moment and live each moment in peace eternally.

LET YOUR LOVE FLOW
There's a reason, for the sunshiny sky, and there's a reason why I'm feeling so high
Must be the season, when that love light shines, all around us.

So let that feeling, grab you deep inside, and send you reeling, where your love can't hide
And then go stealing, through the moonlit nights, with your lover.
    Just let your love flow, like a mountain stream, and let your love grow, with the smallest of dreams
    And let your love show, and you'll know what I mean, it's the season.
    Oh, let your love fly like a bird on a wing, and let your love bind you to all living things
    And let your love shine, and you'll know what I mean, that's the reason.
There's a reason, for the warm sweet nights, and there's a reason, for the candle lights
Must be the season, when those love lights shine, all around us.
So let that wonder, take into space, and lay you under, its loving embrace
Just feel the thunder, as it warms your face, you can't hold back.
    Just let your love flow, like a mountain stream, and let your love grow, with the smallest of dreams
    And let your love show, and you'll know what I mean, it's the season.
    Oh, let your love fly like a bird on a wing, and let your love bind you to all living things
    And let your love shine, and you'll know what I mean, that's the reason.

    Just let your love flow, like a mountain stream, and let your love grow, with the smallest of dreams
    And let your love show, and you'll know what I mean, it's the season.
    Oh, let your love fly like a bird on a wing, and let your love bind you to all living things
    And let your love shine, and you'll know what I mean, that's the reason,   that's the reason,

(THE MAN WHO SHOT) LIBERTY VALANCE
When Liberty Valance rode to town, the women folk would hide, they'd hide
When Liberty Valance walked around, the men would step aside
	Because the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood
	When it came to shootin' straight and fast, he was mighty good
From out of the East a stranger came, a law book in his hand, a man
The kind of a man the West would need to tame a troubled land
	'Cause the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood
	When it came to shootin' straight and fast, he was mighty good
     Many a man would face his gun, and many a man would fall
     The man who shot Liberty Valance, he shot Liberty Valance
     He was the bravest of them all
The love of a girl can make a man stay on when he should go, stay on
Just trying to build a peaceful life, where love is free to grow
	But the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood
	When the final showdown came at last, a law book was no good
Alone and afraid, she prayed that he'd return that fateful night, ah, that night
When nothing she said could keep her man from going out to fight
	From the moment a girl gets to be full grown, the very first thing she learns
	When two men go out to face each other, only one returns
     Everyone heard two shots ring out, one shot made Liberty fall
     The man who shot Liberty Valance, he shot Liberty Valance
     He was the bravest of them all  (repeat last 2 lines)

LIDA ROSE
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose, to get the sun back in my sky
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose, about a thousand kisses shy
Ding, dong, ding, I can hear the chapel bell chime
Ding, dong, ding, at the least suggestion, I'll pop the question.
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose,  without a sweetheart to my name
Lida Rose, now everyone knows that I am hoping you're the same
So here is my love song, not fancy or fine, Lida Rose, oh won't you be mine?
So here is my love song, not fancy or fine, Lida Rose, oh won't you be mine?
Lida Rose, oh, Lida Rose.....Lida Rose, oh, Lida Rose

LIGHTHOUSE
Off the coast of Africa, bound for South America, a world away from here
Is a ship that sails the sea, is a man who's just like me, and I wish that I was there

I'm a lonely lighthouse, not a ship out in the night, I'm watching the sea
She's come halfway 'round the world to see the light, and to stay away from me
	There is a shipwreck lying at my feet, some weary refugee from the rolling deep
	Ah, could you lose it all and fall for me?
     Couldn't we shine? I'm rolling all my golden moments into one
     Like to shine like the sun for one more summer day
     Like to shine like a lighthouse for one last summer night, flashing on, flashing, fading away
Well if you feel lost and lonely, and don't know where to go, and you hear this song on the radio
Or even if you're feeling healthy and strong, you might like to sing along
	But just because I might be standing here, that don't mean I won't be wrong this time
	You could follow me and lose your mind
     Couldn't we shine? Rollin' all my golden moments into one
     Like to shine like the sun for one more summer day
     Like to shine like a lighthouse for one last summer night, flashing on, flashing, fading away
Off the coast of Africa, bound for South America, a world away from here
Is a ship that sails the sea, is a man who's just like me, and I wish that I was there, yeah, yeah, yeah
     I'd like to shine like the sun for one more summer day
     Shine like a lighthouse for one last summer night, see me flashing on, flashing, fading away

LIGHT ONE CANDLE
Light one candle for the Maccabee children, give thanks that their light didn't die
Light one candle for the pain they endured when their right to exist was denied.
Light one candle for the terrible sacrifice justice and freedom demand.
Light one candle for the wisdom to know when the peacemaker's time is at hand.
	Chorus: Don't let the light go out, it's lasted for so many years
                           Don't let the light go out, let it shine through our love and our tears.
Light one candle for the strength that we need to never become our own foe
Light one candle for those who are suffering the pain we learned so long ago.
Light one candle for all we believe in, let anger not tear us apart
Light one candle to bind us together wth the peace as the song in our heart. Chorus:
	Chorus
What is the memory that's valued so highly that we keep alive in that flame?
What's the commitment to those who have died when we cry out, "They've not died in vain."
We have come this far, always believing that justice will somehow prevail
This is the burden and the promise, and this is why we will not fail.
	Chorus:

LIKE  SOMEONE IN LOVE
Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, hearing guitars, like someone in love
Sometimes the things I do astound me, mostly whenever you're around me

Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, bump into things like someone in love
Each time I look at you, I'm limp as a glove and feeling like someone in love
LILI MARLENE
Underneath the lantern, by the barrack gate, darling, I remember the way you used to wait
'Twas there that you whispered, tenderly, that you loved me, you'd always be
My Lili of the lamplight, my own Lili Marlene

Time would come for roll call, time for us to part, darling, I'd caress you, and press you to my heart
And, there, 'neath that far off lantern light, I'd hold you tight, we'd kiss goodnight
My Lili of the lamplight, my own Lili Marlene

Orders came for sailing somewhere over there, all confined to barracks 'twas more than I could bear
I knew you were waiting in the street, I heard your feet, but could not meet
My Lili of the lamplight, my own Lili Marlene

Resting in our billet, just behind the line, even though we're parted, your lips are close to mine
You wait where that lantern softly gleamed, your sweet face seems to haunt my dreams
My Lili of the lamplight, my own Lili Marlene; my Lili of the lamplight, my own Lili Marlene

LINDA
When I go to sleep, I never count sheep, I count all the charms about Linda
And lately it seems, in all of my dreams, I walk with my arms about Linda
	But what good does it do me, for Linda doesn't know i exist
	Can't help feeling gloomy, think of all the lovin' I've missed
We pass on the street, my heart skips a beat, I say to myself, "Hello, Linda."
If only she'd smile, I'd stop here a while, and then I would get to know Linda
	But miracles still happen, and when my lucky star begins to shine
	With one lucky break, I'll make Linda mine  (repeat last two lines)

LISTEN TO THE MOCKINGBIRD
I'm dreaming now of Hallie, my sweet Hallie, sweet Hallie
I'm dreaming now of Hallie, for the thought of her is one that never dies.
She's sleeping in the valley, the valley, my sweet Hallie
She's sleeping in the valley, and the mockingbird is singing where she lies.
	Listen to the mockingbird, listen to the mockingbird,
	The mocking bird, still singing o'er her grave
	Listen to the mockingbird, listen to the mockingbird,
	Still singing where the weeping willows wave
Ah, well I yet remember, remember, remember,
Ah, well I yet remember, when we gathered in the cotton, side by side
'Twas in the mild September, September, September
'Twas in the mild September, and the mockingbird was singing far and wide
	Chorus
When the charms of Spring awaken, awaken, awaken
When the charms of Spring awaken, and the mockingbird is singing on the bough
I feel like one forsaken, forsaken, forsaken
I feel like one forsaken, for my Hallie is no longer with me now.
	Chorus

LISTEN TO THE MUSIC
Don't you feel it growin', day by day, people gettin' ready for the news
Some are happy, some are sad, oh, we got to let the music play
What the people need is a way to make 'em smile. It ain't so hard to do if you know how
Gotta get a message, get it on through, oh, now mama's go'n' to after 'while
	Oh, oh, listen to the music, oh, oh, listen to the music
	Oh, oh, listen to the music all the time
Well I know, you know better, everything I say. Meet me in the country for a day
We'll be happy, and we'll dance. Oh, we're gonna dance our blues away
And if I'm feelin' good to you, and you're feelin' good to me. There ain't nothin' we can't do or say
Feelin' good, feeling fine, oh, baby, let the music play
	Oh, oh, listen to the music, oh, oh, listen to the music
	Oh, oh, listen to the music all the time
     Like a lazy flowing river, surrounding castles in the sky
     And the crowd is growing bigger, listenin' for the happy sounds, and I got to let them fly
	Oh, oh, listen to the music, oh, oh, listen to the music
	Oh, oh, listen to the music all the time

LITTLE BIT O' SOUL
Now, when you're feelin' low, and the fish won't bite
You need a little bit o' soul to put you right
You gotta make like you wanna kneel and pray
And then a little bit o' soul will come your way

Now, when your girl is gone, and you're broke in two
You need a little bit o' soul to see you through
And when you raise the roof with your rock 'n' roll
You'll get a lot more kicks with a little bit o' soul
	And when your party falls 'cause ain't nobody groovin'
	A little bit o' soul, and it really starts movin', yeah
And when you're in a mess, and you feel like cryin'
Just remember this little song of mine
And as you go through life tryin' to reach your goal
Just remember what I said about a little bit o' soul

A little bit o' soul, yeah, a little bit o' soul  (X4)

LITTLE BITTY PRETTY ONE
	Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mm
Little bitty pretty one, come on and talk-a to me
Lovey dovey lovey one, come, sit down on my knee
	Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Tell you a story, happened long time ago
A-little bitty pretty one, I've been watchin' you grow
	Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Little bitty pretty one, come on and talk-a to me
Lovey dovey lovey one, come, sit down on my knee

A LITTLE BITTY TEAR LET ME DOWN
	A little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown.
	I had it made up not to make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down.
When you said you were leaving tomorrow, that today was our last day,
I said there'd be no sorrow, that I'd  laugh when you walked away.
	But a little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown.
	I had it made up not to make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down.
I said I'd laugh when you left me, pull a funny as you went out the door.
That I'd have another one waitin', and I'd wave good-bye as you go
	But a little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown.
	I had it made up not to make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down.
Everything went like I planned it, and I really put on quite a show.
In my heart I felt I could stand it, 'til you walked with your grip through the door.
	Then a little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown.
	I had it made up not to make a frown, oh, but a little bitty tear let me down.
	A little bitty tear let me down, a little bitty tear let me down.

LITTLE BOAT
My little boat is like a note bouncing merrily along, hear it splashing up a song
The sails of white, the sky is bright, heading out into the blue with a crew of only two
Where we can share love's salty air on a little paradise that's afloat
Not a care have we in my little boat
The wind is still, we feel the thrill of a voyage heaven-bound, though we only drift around
Warmed by the sun, two hearts as one, pounding with enchanted bliss with each other's kis
When daylight ends and slyly sends little stars that twinkle brightly above
It's good bye to you, little boat of love

LITTLE DARLIN'
Ah, ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya
Little darling, oh little darling, oh where are you?
My lover, I was wrong to try to love two
Ahh uha uha uha uha
Know well that my love was just for you, uh only you
	My darling I need you to call my own, and never to wrong,
	To hold in mine your little hand.
	I'll know too soon that all is so grand. Please hold my hand
My dear, I was wrong to try to love two
Ahh uha uha uha uha
Know well that my love was just for you, o-only you

LITTLE GIRL BLUE
     When you were very young, the world was younger than you, as merry as a carousel
     The circus tent was strung with every star in the sky, above the ring you loved so well
     Now the young world has grown old, gone are the tinsel and gold........
Sit there and count your fingers, what can you do? Old girl, you're through
Sit there and count your little fingers, unlucky little girl blue
Sit there and count the rain-drops, falling on you, it's time you knew
All you can count on is the raindrops that fall on little girl blue.
No use, old girl, you may as  well surrender, your hopes are getting slender
Why won't somebody send  a  tender blue boy, to cheer up little girl blue

LITTLE GREEN APPLES
	And I wake up in the mornin' with my hair down in my eyes, and she says "Hi"
	And I stumble to the breakfast table, while the kids are goin' off to school, goodbye
	And she reaches out and takes my hand and squeezes it and says "How ya feelin', hon?"
	And I look across at smilin' lips that warm my heart and see my mornin' sun
	And if that's not lovin' me, then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples, and it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss, or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme

God didn't make little green apples, and it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when my self is feelin' low, I think about her face aglow and ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy
And ask her if she could get away and meet me, and maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me, and I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me, 'cause she's made that way
	And if that's not lovin' me, then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples, and it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when my self is feelin' low, I think about her face aglow and ease my mind

LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
	Owoooooooo! Who's that I see walkin' in these woods?
	Why, it's Little Red Riding Hood.
Hey there, Little Red Riding Hood, you sure are looking good.
You're everything a big bad wolf could want. Listen to me.

Little Red Riding Hood, I don't think little big girls should
Go walking in these spooky old woods alone. Owooooooo!
	What big eyes you have, the kind of eyes that drive wolves mad.
	So just to see that you don't get chased, I think I ought to walk with you for a ways.
	What full lips you have, they're sure to lure someone bad.
	So, until you get to grandma's place, I think you ought to walk with me and be safe.
I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on until I'm sure that you've been shown
That I can be trusted walking with you alone. Owooooooooo!

Little Red Riding Hood, I'd like to hold you if I could
But you might think I'm a big bad wolf so I won't. Owoooooooo !
	What a big heart I have-the better to love you with
	Little Red Riding Hood, even bad wolves can be good
	I'll try to keep satisfied just to walk close by your side
Little Red Riding Hood, you sure are looking good
You're everything that a big bad wolf could want.
      Owoooooooo! I mean baaaaaad! Baaad?

LITTLE RICHARD MEDLEY
Keep a-knockin', but you can't come in, keep a-knockin', but you can't come in,
Keep a-knockin', but you can't come in, come back tomorrow night, and try it again
You said you love me, but you can't come in, you said you love me, but you can't come in,
You said you love me, but you can't come in, come back tomorrow night, and try it again

LITTLE SHOEMAKER
In the shoemaker's shop this re-frain would never stop
As he tapped away, working all the day
At his bench, there was he, just as busy as a bee
Little time to lose for the boots and shoes
But his heart went "pop" inside the little shopWhen a lovely girl set him all a-whirl
She had come to choose some pretty dancing shoesAnd he heard her say in a charming way
	I want some shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing all the day
	Shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing, dancing all my cares away
Then he tapped and he stitched for his fingers were bewitched
And he sewed a dream into every seam
Making shoes, oh, so neat just like magic on her feet
And he hoped she'd know that he loved her so
But she danced, danced, danced, as though she were entranced
Like a spinning top all around the shop
On her dainty feet she whirled 'em in the street
And he heard her say as she danced away
	I want some shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing all the day
	Shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing, dancing all my cares away

THE LITTLE THINGS IN LIFE
Just a little room or two can more than do a little man and wife
That's if they're contented with the little things in life

Living on a larger scale would soon entail a lot of care and strife
We could be so happy with the little things in life
	A little rain, a little sun, a little work, a little fun
	A little time for loving when the day is done
And a little thing that cries for lullabies could make a man and wife
Tell the world how much they love the little things in life

And a little thing that cries for lullabies could make a man and wife
Tell the world how much they love the little things in life
We'll tell the world how much we love the little things in life

LITTLE THINGS MEAN A LOT
Blow her a kiss from across the room, say she looks nice when she's not
Touch her hand as you pass her chair, little things mean a lot

Give her your arm as you cross the street, call her at six on the dot
Align a day when you're far away, little things mean a lot

Don't have to buy her diamonds and pearls, champagne, sables and stuffs
She doesn't care much for diamonds and pearls
She'll laugh and say, "Honey, they just cost money"

So give her your hand when she's lost the way, and give her your shoulder to cry on
Whether the day is sunny or gray, give her your heart to rely on

Send her the warmth of a secret smile, to show her you haven't forgot
That always and ever, for now and forever, little things mean a lot

LIVE FOR LIFE
Come with me my love and seize the day and live it, live it fully, live it fast.
Never thinking once about tomorrow, till tomorrow's been and gone and past.
We'll pour the wine and fill the cup of joy and drink it, drink as if it were our last.
Live, just live for life.

In Paree today, in Amsterdam tomorrow, sixty minutes through the skies.
Fly with me to see the setting summer sun, and stay with me to see it rise.
And say to those who say to live this way is mad, that mad we'd rather be, than wise.
Live, just live for life.
	  If you let me, I will lead you through the mystery and wonder,
	  Of a world you've never known before.
	  Share the splendors to be shared. Magic places to explore
	  Dare the dangers to be dared. Life is all of this and more, this and more.
Yesterday's a memory, gone for good, forever, and tomorrow is a guess.
What is real is what is here and now, the "here and now" is all that we possess.
So, take my hand and we will take the moment, if for just the moment's happiness.
Live, just live for life.

Come with me to where the hills are green and still, and filled with flowers to adore.
Come with me to where the laughter rings, and drowns the pounding sounds of guns of war.
Yes, come with me my love, and live for life, and life will live for you forevermore.
Live,  just live for life, live, just live for life,
Just live for life, just live for life!

LIZA, ALL THE CLOUDS'LL ROLL AWAY
Liza, Liza, skies are gray, but, if you smile on me, all the clouds'll roll away
Liza, Liza, don't delay, come keep me company, and all the clouds'll roll away
	See the honey moon is shinin' down, we should make a date with Parson Brown
So, Liza, Liza, name the day, when you belong to me, and the clouds'll roll away
	See the honey moon is shinin' down, we should make a date with Parson Brown
So, Liza, Liza, name the day, when you belong to me, and the clouds'll roll away
When you belong to me, and the clouds'll roll away

LOLLIPOPS AND ROSES
Tell her you care each time you speak, make it her birthday each day of the week,
Bring her nice things, sugar-and-spice things, roses and lollipops and lollipops and roses.
One day she´ll smile, next day she´ll cry. Minute to minute you´ll never know why.
Coax her, pet her, better yet get her roses and lollipops and lollipops and roses.
	We try acting grownup, but, as a rule,
	We´re all little children, fresh from school
So carry her books, that´s how it starts. Fourteen or forty, they´re kids in their hearts.
Keep them handy, flowers and candy, roses and lollipops and lollipops and roses,
Roses and lollipops and lollipops and roses

LONELY BOY
I'm just a lonely boy, lonely and blue, I'm alone, with nothing to do
I've got everything you could think of, but all I want is someone to love
Someone, yes, someone to love, someone to kiss, someone to hold at a moment like this
I'd like to hear somebody say, "I'll give you my love, each night and day."
Someone, yes, someone to love, someone to kiss, someone to hold at a moment like this
I'd like to hear somebody say, "I'll give you my love, each night and day."

GOODNIGHT, MY LOVE
Goodnight, my love, pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright, and bring you closer to me
Before you go, there's just one thing I'd like to know:
If your love is still warm for me, or has it gone cold
If you should awake in the still of the night, please have no fear
For I'll be there, darling, you know I care. Please give your love to me, dear, only
Goodnight, my love, pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright, and bring you closer to me

PUPPY LOVE
And they called it "puppy love," oh, I guess they'll never know
How a young heart, how it really feels, and why love her so.
And they called it "puppy love," just because we're seventeen
Tell them all, oh, please tell them it isn't fair to take away my only dream
I cry each night, these tears for you, my tears are all in vain
Oh I hope, I hope and I pray that, maybe some day, you'll  be back in my arms once again
Someone help me, help me please, is the answer up above?
How can I, oh, how can I ever tell them, oh, this is not a "puppy love"
Someone help me, help me please, is the answer up above?
How can I, oh, how can I ever tell them, oh, this is not a "puppy love"

LONELY PEOPLE
This is for all the lonely people, thinking that life has passed them by
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup, and ride that highway in the sky
This is for all the single people, thinking that love has left them dry
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup, you never know until you try
	Well, I'm on my way, yes, I'm back to stay
	Well, I'm on my way back home (Hit it)
This is for all the lonely people, thinking that life has passed them by
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
And never take you down or never give you up
You never know until you try

LONELY TOO LONG
I've been lonely too long, I've been lonely too long
In the past it's come and gone, I feel like I can't go on without love
     I've been lonely too long (he's been lonely too long), I've been lonely too long (he's been lonely)
As I look back, I can see me lost and searching,
Now I find that I can choose, I'm free, oh yeah
So funny I just have to laugh, all my troubles been torn in half
     I been lonely too long (he's been lonely too long), lonely too long (he's been lonely)
	In the past it's come and gone, I feel like I can't go on without love
	(he's been lonely) lonely too long, I've been lonely so long (he's been lonely)
Just see me now. Makes it worth the time I've waited.
She was all I need to make me see, oh yeah
I keep hopin' with all my mind, everything gonna turn out right
     I've been lonely too long (he's been lonely too long), lonely so long (he's been lonely)
Now look at me, gliding through this world of beauty.
Everything I do brings ecstasy, oh yeah
No wonder I could die, I feel like I'm 'bout ten miles high
     I've been lonely too long (he's been lonely too long), lonely too long (he's been lonely)  (X2)

LONESOME TOWN
There's a place where lovers go to cry their troubles away
And they call it lonesome town, where the broken hearts stay

You can buy a dream or two to last you all through the years
And the only price you pay is a heart full of tears
	Goin' down to lonesome town, where the broken hearts stay
	Goin' down to lonesome town, to cry my troubles away
In the town of broken dreams, the streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in lonesome town, I can learn to forget
Maybe down in lonesome town, I can learn to forget

LONG ABOUT NOW
Long about now my woman's waking, wiping the sleep from out of her eyes
Starting a smile so warm, that smile is making the morning sun ashamed to rise
	Long about now my woman's bending, tending the fire and setting the bread
	Starting a song so sweet, that at its ending, that fire's burning extra red
Long about now my woman's waiting, shading the sun from off of her brow
Searching the winding road, with eyes that try to find me,
And longing after me, long about now
And longing after me, long about now, long about now, long about now.

LONG AGO AND FAR AWAY
Long ago, a young man sits and plays his waiting game.
But things are not the same, it seems, as in such tender dreams.
Slowly passing sailing ships, and Sunday afternoon.
Like people on the moon, I see, are things not meant to be.
	Where do those golden rainbows end? Why is this song so sad?
	Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed, my friend, loving the love I love to
Love is just a word I've heard when things are being said.
Stories my poor head has told me cannot stand the cold.
And in between what might have been and what has come to pass,
A misbegotten guess, alas, and bits of broken glass.
	Where do your golden rainbows end? Why is this song I sing so sad?
	Dreaming the dreams I dream my friend, loving the love I love to love to love to love.

LONG, BLACK RIFLE
Come closer, my love, and you'll hear my tale.  It'll make you cold. It'll turn you pale.
It's a tale of a man's never ending love and a long, black rifle.
	He wed a woman sworn to another and, in a rage, the other man
	Shot him down with a long, black rifle, shot him down and away he ran.
A prairie man loved a city maid. Was the love he took worth the price he paid,
When a man ends up at the smoky end of a long, black rifle?
	He wed a woman sworn to another and, in a rage, the other man
	Shot him down with a long, black rifle, shot him down and away he ran.
His dying words I repeat to you. "You can never kill love when love is true.
It lives when only the rust is left of a long, black rifle."
	He wed a woman sworn to another and, in a rage, the other man
	Shot him down with a long, black rifle, shot him down and away he ran.
	Shot him down and away he ran.

LONG LONG AGO
Tell me the tales that to me were so dear, long, long ago, long, long ago
Sing me the songs I delighted to hear, long, long ago, long ago
	Now you are come, all my fears are removed
	Let me forget that so long you have rov'd
	Let me believe that you love as you lov'd
	Long, long ago, long ago
Do you remember the path where we met, long, long ago, long, long ago
Ah yes, you told me you ne'er would forget, long, long ago, long ago
	Then, to all others, my smile you preferred
	Love, when you spoke, gave a charm to each word
	Still my heart treasures the praises I heard, long, long ago, long ago

LONG, LONG TIME
Love will abide, take things in stride. Sounds like good advice but there's no one at my side
And time washes clean love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me but I don't know what it means
	'Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
	And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time
Caught in my fears, blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me when you never let me near
And I never drew one response from you
All the while you fell all over girls you never knew
	'Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
	And I think it's gonna hurt me for a long long time
Wait for the day, you'll go away, knowing that you warned me of the price I'd have to pay
And life's full of flaws. Who knows the cause?
Living in the memory of a love that never was
	'Cause I've done everything I know to try and change your mind
	And I think I'm gonna miss you for a long long time
	'Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
	And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time

LONG TALL TEXAN
Well, I'm a long tall Texan, I ride a big white horse. (He rides from Texas on a big white horse.)
Yes, I'm a long tall Texan, I ride a big white horse. (He rides from Texas on a big white horse.)
And people look at me and they say,    Oh Roy, Oh Roy, is that your horse?
Well, I'm a long tall Texan, I wear a ten-gallon hat. (He rides from Texas with a ten-gallon hat.)
Yes, I'm a long tall Texan, I wear a ten-gallon hat. (He rides from Texas with a ten-gallon hat.)
People look at me and they say,      Oh Roy, Oh Roy, is that your hat?
	Well, I was walking down the street with my shiny badge, my big spurs jingling at my feet
	Well, I saw a man comin', comin' with a gun, 'n well,      I just can't be beat.
Yes, I'm a long tall Texan, I enforce justice for the law. (He rides from Texas to enforce the law.)
Well, I'm a long tall Texan, I enforce justice for the law. (He rides from Texas to enforce the law.)
People look at me and they say,      Oh Roy, Oh Roy, is you da law?

LOOK FOR THE SILVER LINING
Look for the silver lining whenever a cloud appears in the blue
Remember somewhere the sun is shining
	And so the right thing to do is make it shine for you
A heart full of joy and gladness will always banish sadness and strife
So always look for the silver lining,  and try to find the sunny side of life  (repeat song)

LOOKING AT THE WORLD THROUGH ROSE COLORED GLASSES
	     I said goodbye to Mr. Sorrow, how do you do, Mr. Joy?
	     Don't need to worry 'bout tomorrow
	     Look at me, and you'll see a soul who's happy as can be, because...
I'm lookin' at the world through rose colored glasses, everything is rosy now.
Lookin' at the world and everything that passes, seems of rosy hue somehow

Why do I feel so spry? don't wink your eye,
Needn't guess I'll confess, certain someone just said yes.
In a bungalow all covered with roses, I will settle down I vow,
Because I'm lookin' at the world through rose colored glasses, and everything is rosy now.

LOOKING THROUGH THE EYES OF LOVE
Please, don't let this feeling end, it's everything I am, everything I want to be
I can see what's mine now, finding out what's true
Since I found you, looking through the eyes of love

Now, I can take the time, I can see my life as it comes up shining now
Reaching out to touch you, I can feel so much
Since I found you, looking through the eyes of love
	And now, I do believe that, even in a storm, we'll find some light
	Knowing you're beside me, I'm alright
Please, don't let this feeling end, it might not come again, and I want to remember
How it feels to touch you, how I feel so much
Since I found you, looking through the eyes of love
	And now, I do believe that, even in a storm, we'll find some light
	Knowing you're beside me, I'm alright
Now, I can take the time, I can see my life as it comes up shining now
Reaching out to touch you, I can feel so much
Since I found you, looking through the eyes of love

LOOKIN' OUT MY BACK DOOR
Just got home from Illinois. Lock the front door oh boy.
Got to set down, take a rest on the porch.
Imagination sets in, pretty soon I'm singin', doo doo doo, lookin' out my back door.

Giant doin' cart wheels, a statue wearin' high heels
Look at all the happy creatures dancin' on the lawn.
Dinosaur Victrola, listenin' to Buck Owens, doo doo doo, lookin out my back door.
	Tambourines and elephants are playin' in the band.
	Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon, doo doo doo.
Wonderous apparition, provided by magician, doo doo doo, lookin out my back door.
	Tambourines and elephants are playin' in the band.
	Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon, doo doo doo.
Smile with me tomorrow, today I'll find no sorrow, doo doo doo, lookin out my back door.

Forward troubles Illinois. Lock the front door oh boy.
Look at all the happy creatures, dancin' on the lawn.
Bother me tomorrow, today I'll find no sorrow, doo doo doo, lookin' out my back door.

THE LOOK OF LOVE
The look of love is in your eyes, a look your smile can't disguise
The look of love is saying so much more than just words could ever say
And what my heart has heard, well, it takes my breath away
	I can hardly wait to hold you, feel my arms around you
	How long I have waited, waited just to love you, now that I have found you
You've got the look of love, it's on your face. A look that time can't erase
Be mine tonight, let this be just the start of so many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow and then seal it with a kiss
	I can hardly wait to hold you, feel my arms around you
	How long I have waited, waited just to love you, now that I have found you
	Don't ever go, don't ever go, I love you so.


LOOK OVER THERE
How often is someone concerned with the tiniest thread of your life?
Concerned with whatever you feel, and whatever you touch?
Look over there, look over there. Somebody cares that much
How often can somebody sense that you need them without being told
When you have a hurt in your heart, you're too proud to disclose
Look over there, look over there, somebody always knows
When your world spins too fast, and your bubble has burst
Someone puts herself last, so that you can come first.
So count all the loves who will  love from now 'til the end of your life
And when you have added the loves who have loved you before
Look over there, look over there, somebody loves you more, somebody loves you more.

LOOK TO THE RAINBOW
On the day I was born, said my father, said he, I've an elegant legacy waiting for ye
'Tis a rhyme for you lips, and a song for your heart,
To sing it whenever the world falls apart
　　　　Look, look, look to the rainbow, follow it over the hill and stream
　　　　Look, look, look to the rainbow, follow the fellow who follows a dream
'Twas a sumptuous gift to bequeath to a child,
Oh, the lure of that song kept her feet running wild
For you never grow old, and you never stand still
With whippoorwills singing beyond the next hill
　　　　Look, look, look to the rainbow, follow it over the hill and stream
　　　　Look, look, look to the rainbow, follow the fellow who follows a dream
So, I bundled me heart, and I roamed the world free
To the east with the lark, to the west with the sea
And I'll search on the earth, and I'll scan all the skies
'Til I find it at last in my own true love's eyes
　　　　Look, look, look to the rainbow, follow it over the hill and stream
　　　　Look, look, look to the rainbow, follow the fellow who follows a dream
　　　　Follow the fellow, follow the fellow, follow the fellow who follows a dream

LOSING YOU
Don't sigh a sigh for me, don't ever cry for me
This is goodbye from me, I know we're through, I'm losing you

Love sang it's song for me, then things went wrong for me
Nights are too long for me, because I'm losing you
	Our love, and our devotion were deep... as any ocean
	Then one day, like the tide, you began to change
	And you became a perfect stranger
Someone is holding you, sharing the lips I knew
I can't believe it's true, that I am losing you

A LOT OF LIVIN' TO DO
There are girls just ripe for some kissin', and I mean to kiss me a few
Oh, those girls don't know what they're missin', I've got a lot of livin' to do
And there's wine, all ready for tastin', and there's Cadillacs all shiny and new
Gotta move, 'cause time is a-wastin', there's such a lot of livin' to do.
There's music to play, places to go, people to see, everything for you and me!
Life's a ball, if only you know it. And it's all just waitin' for you
You're alive, so come on and show it! There's such a lot of livin',
Such a lot of livin', such a lot of livin' to do!

LOUISE
	Wonderful! Oh it's wonderful, to be in love with you.
	Beautiful, you're so beautiful, you haunt me all day through.
Every little breeze seems to whisper "Louise."
Birds in the trees seem to twitter "Louise."
Each little rose tells me it knows I love you. (love you)

Every little beat that I feel in my heart, seems to repeat what I felt at the start.
Each little sigh tells me that I adore you, Louise.
	Just to see and hear you is joy I never knew,
	But to be so near you thrills me through and through.
Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss. It had to be, but the wonder is this:
Can it be true, someone like you could love me, Louise.

L.O.V.E
L is for the way you Look at me.
O is for the Only one I see.
V  is Very, Very extraordinary.
E  is Even  more than anyone that you adore can.
Love is all that I can give to you, Love is more than just a game for two.
Two in Love can make it. Take my heart and please don't break it.
Love was made for me and you. Love was made for me and you

LOVE AND MARRIAGE
Love and marriage, love and marriage, go together like a horse and carriage;
This I tell you, brother, you can't have one without the other.
Love and marriage, love and marriage it's an institute you can't disparage.
Ask the local gentry and they will say it's element'ry
	Try, try, try to separate them it's an illusion;
	Try, try, try, and you will only come to this conclusion.
Love and marriage, love and marriage, go together like a horse and carriage;
Dad was told by mother, you can't have one, you can't have none,
You can't have one without the other.

LOVE  GROWS (WHERE MY ROSEMARY GOES)
She ain't got no money, her clothes are  kinda funny, her hair is kinda wild and free
Oh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes, and nobody knows like me

She talks kinda lazy, and people say she's crazy, and her life's a mystery
Oh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes, and nobody knows like me
	There's somethin' about her hand holding mine,
	It's a feeling that's fine, and I just gotta say
	She's really got a magical spell, and it's working so well, that I can't get away
I'm a lucky fella, and I've just got to tell her, that I love her endlessly
Because love grows where my Rosemary goes, and nobody knows like me
	There's somethin' about her hand holding mine,
	It's a feeling that's fine, and I just gotta say
	She's really got a magical spell, and it's working so well, that I can't get away
I'm a lucky fella, and I've just got to tell her, that I love her endlessly
Because love grows where my Rosemary goes, and nobody knows like me
Because love grows where my Rosemary goes, and nobody knows like me

LOVE HAS NO PRIDE
I've had bad dreams too many times, to think that they don't mean much anymore
Fine times have gone and left my sad home, and the friends who once cared just walked out my door
	Love has no pride when I call out your name.
	And love has no pride when there's no one to blame. But I'd give anything to see you again
I've been alone too many nights, to think that you could come back again
And I've heard you talk, "he's crazy to stay, "but this love hurts me so, I don't care what you say
	'Cause love has no pride when I call out your name.
	And love has no pride when there's no one to blame. And I'd give anything to see you again
     If I could buy your love, well I'd surly try, my friend
     And if I could pray, my prayers would never end
     But if you want me to beg, I'll fall down on my knees
     And ask you to come back, I'd be pleading for you to come back
     I'd beg for you to come back to me
	Love has no pride when I call out your name.
	And Love has no pride when there's no one but myself to blame.
	And I'd give any-thing to see you again. Yes, I'd give anything to see  you again

LOVE HURTS
Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and mars. Any heart not tough nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain, love hurts, love hurts

I'm young, I know, but even so, I know a thing or two, I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove, burns you when it's hot, love hurts, love hurts
	Some fools rave of happiness, blissfulness, togetherness
	Some fools fool themselves, I guess, but they're not fooling me
I know it isn't true, know it isn't true
Love is just a lie, made to make you blue, love hurts, love hurts

LOVE IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING
Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early spring
Love is nature's way of giving, a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king

Once on a high and windy hill
In the morning mist, two lovers kissed, and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's, a many splendored thing

LOVE IS BLUE
Blue, blue, my world is blue, blue is my world, since I'm without you
Gray, gray, my life is gray, cold is my heart since you went away

Red, red, my eyes are red, crying for you alone in my bed
Green, green, my jealous heart, I doubted you and now we're apart
	When we met, how the bright sun shone
	Then love died, now the rainbow is gone
Black, black, the nights I've known, longing for you, so lost and alone
Gone, gone, the love we knew, blue is my world, now I'm without you.

LOVE IS IN THE AIR
Love is in the air everywhere I look around.
Love is in the air every sight and every sound
And I don't know if I'm being foolish, don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe in, and it's there when I look in your eyes.

Love is in the air, in the whisper of the tree
Love is in the air in the thunder of the sea
And I don't know if I'm just dreaming, don't know if I feel safe
But it's something that I must believe in, and it's there when you call out my name
Love is in the air, love is in the air, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh
Love is in the air, in the rising of the sun
Love is in the air, when the day is nearly done
And I don't know if you are illusion, don't know if I see truth
But you are something that I must believe in, and you are there when I reach out for you

Love is in the air everywhere I look around.
Love is in the air every sight and every sound
And I don't know if I'm being foolish, don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe in, and it's there when I look in your eyes.
Love is in the air, love is in the air, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh

LOVE IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER
Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner
Love is just around the corner, when I'm around you

I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner
When you keep me on a corner, just waiting for you
	Venus de Milo was noted for her charms
	But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus, and what's more, you've got arms!
So, let's go cuddle in a corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner, and I'm around you.

LOVE LETTERS
Love letters, straight from your heart, keep us so near, while apart
I'm not alone in the night, when I can have all the love that you write
I memorize every line, I kiss the name that you sign
And, darling, then I read again, right from the start
Love letters, straight from your heart

LOVE LETTERS IN THE SAND
On a day like today we passed the time a-way writing love letters in the sand
How you laughed when I cried each time I saw the tide take our love letters in the sand
You made a vow that you would always be true
But some-how that vow meant nothing to you
Now my poor heart just aches with every wave it breaks over love letters in the sand
Now my poor heart just aches with every wave it breaks over love letters in the sand

LOVELY DAY
When I wake up in the morning, love, and the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love, bears heavy on my mind
	Then I look at you, and the world's alright with me
	Just one look at you, and I know it's gonna be a lovely day, lovely day, etc.
When the day that lies ahead of me seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me always seems to know the way
	Then I look at you, and the world's alright with me
	Just one look at you, and I know it's gonna be a lovely day, lovely day, etc.
When the day that lies ahead of me seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me always seems to know the way
	Then I look at you, and the world's alright with me
	Just one look at you, and I know it's gonna be a lovely day, lovely day, etc.

A LOVELY WAY TO SPEND AN EVENING
	Some like a night at the movies, some like a dance or a show
	Some are content with an evening spent home by the radio
	Some like to live for the moment, some like to reminisce
	But, whenever I have an evening to spend, just give me one like this
This is a lovely way to spend an evening, can't think of anything I'd rather do
This is a lovely way to spend an evening, can't think of anyone as lovely as you
	A casual stroll through a garden, a kiss by a lazy lagoon
	Catching a breath of moonlight, humming our favorite tune
This is a lovely way to spend an evening, I want to save all my nights, and spend them with you

LOVE MAKES THE WORLD GO 'ROUND-CARNIVAL
Love makes the world go round, love makes the world go round
Somebody soon will love you, if no one loves you now

High in some silent sky, love sings a silver song
Making the earth whirl softly, love makes the world go round

LOVE ME
Treat me like a fool, treat me mean and cruel, but love me.
Break my faithful heart, tear it all apart, but love me.
If you ever go,  darling, I'll be, oh, so lonely
I'll be sad and blue, cryin' over you, dear always
	I would beg and steal (he would beg and steal) just to feel (yes, just to feel)
	Your heart (I want your heart) beating close to mine (so close to mine)
If you ever go, darling, I'll be, oh, so lonely
Beggin' on my knees, all I ask is please, please love me.

LOVE ME DO
Love me do, you know I love you, I'll always be true,
So, please, love me do, whoa, love me do

Love me do, you know I love you, I'll always be true,
So, please, love me do, whoa, love me do
	Someone to love, somebody new, someone to love, someone like you
Love me do, you know I love you, I'll always be true,
So, please, love me do, whoa, love me do

LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME
Love me or leave me, and let me be lonely.
You won't believe me, and I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night-time the right time for kissing,
But night-time is my time for just reminiscing,
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
	There'll be no one, unless that someone is you
	I intend  to be independently blue
I want your love, but I don't want to borrow
To have it today, and to give back tomorrow
For my love is your love, there's no love for nobody else

LOVE ME TENDER
Love me tender, love me sweet; never let me go. You have made my life complete, and I love you so.
Love me tender, love me true; all my dreams fulfill. For, my darling, I love you, and I always will.
Love me tender, love me long, take me to your heart. For it's there that I belong, and we'll never part.
Love me tender, love me true, all my dreams fulfill.
For, my darling, I love you, and I always will   (X2)

LOVE ME TONIGHT
I know that it's late and I really must leave you alone
But you're good to hold, and I feel such a long way from home
Yes, I know that our love is still new, but I promise it's gonna be true
Please let me stay, don't you send me away, oh, no no! Aaahh
	Tell me baby that you need me, say you'll never leave me, love me tonight
	Hold me now my heart is aching, and, until the dawn is breaking, love me tonight
	Something is burning inside, something that can't be denied
	I can't let you out of my sight, darling, love me tonight
     Let me love you, baby, let me love you, baby, baby, love me tonight
I've waited so long for the girl of my dreams to appear
And now I can hardly believe that you really are here
Here in my arms you belong, how can this feeling be wrong
Darling be kind for I'm out of my mind over you. Aaahh
	Tell me baby that you need me, say you'll never leave me, love me tonight
	Baby, now the pain is stronger, I can't wait a moment longer, love me tonight
	Something is burning inside, something that can't be denied
	I can't let you out of my sight, darling, love me tonight
     Let me love you, baby, let me love you, baby, let me love me tonight
     Love me tonight!

LOVE POTION NUMBER NINE
I took my troubles down to Madame Ruth. You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth
She's got a pad down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine, sellin' little bottles of Love Potion Number Nine

I told her that I was a flop with chicks, I've been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign.
She said "What you need is Love Potion Number Nine"
	She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink
	She said "I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink"
	It smelled like turpentine, it looked like India Ink*
	I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink
I didn't know if it was day or night, I started kissin' everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine

LOVE WALKED IN
Nothing seemed to matter any more, didn't care what I was headed for.
Time was standing still, no one counted till
There came a knocking, knocking at my door.
Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

LOVE WILL KEEP US TOGETHER
Love, love will keep us together, think of me, babe, when-ever
Some sweet talking guy comes along, singing a song
Don't mess around, you just got to be strong
Just stop, 'cause I really love you, stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together

You, you belong to me now, ain't gonna set you free now
When those guys start hanging around, talking me down
Hear with your heart and you won't hear a sound
Just stop, 'cause I really love you, stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together, whatever
	Young and beautiful someday your looks will be gone
	When the others turn you off, who'll be turning you on? I will, I will, I will!
I will be there to share forever, love will keep us together
Said it before and I'll say it again, while others pretend,
  I need you now and I'll need you then
Just stop, 'cause I really love you, stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together, whatever.  I will, I will, I will
Stop, 'cause I really love you, stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together, whatever.  I will, I will, I will,

LOVER
Lover, when I'm near you, and I hear you speak my name, softly in my ear you breathe a flame
Lover, when we're dancing, keep on glancing in my eyes, till love's own enchanting music dies
All of my future is in you, you're every plan I design, promise you'll always continue to be mine
Lover,  please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart, lover, I surrender to my heart

LOVER, PLEASE
	Lover, please, please come back don't take a train comin' down the track
Don't please don't, don't leave me, don't leave me in misery
You would never hold me near you would never call me dear
Don't you know I'd die for you now you're gone that's what I'll do
	Lover, please, please come back...
Old, old story, not too long, about a love that went all wrong
The girl left the boy, boy went bad, now he's gone and she's so sad
	Lover, please, please come back...

LOVER'S CONCERTO
How gentle is the rain that falls softly on the meadow
Birds, high up in the trees, serenade the flowers with their melodies, oh,
See, there beyond the hill, the bright colors of the rainbow
Some magic from above made this day for us, just to fall in love

Now I belong to you, from this day until forever
Just love me tenderly, and I'll give to you every part of me, oh
Don't ever make me cry, through long, lonely nights without love
Be always true to me, keep this day in your heart eternally

Someday we shall return to this place upon the meadow
We'll walk out in the rain, hear the birds above, singing once again
You'll hold me in your arms, and say once again you love me
And if your love is true, everything will be just as wonderful

LOVER'S QUESTION
Does she love me, with all her heart, should I worry, when we're apart
It's a lover's question, I'd like to know.

Does she need me, as she pretends, is this a game, well then will I win
It's a lover's question, I'd like to know.
	I'd like to know when she's not with me, if she's still true to me
	I'd like to know when we're kissing, does she feel just what I feel,
	And how am I to know it's really real.
Oh, tell me where, the answer lies, is it in her kiss or in her eyes
It's a lover's question I'd like to know.

LOVE'S IN NEED OF LOVE TODAY
Good morn or evening friends, here's your friendly announcer
I have serious news to pass on to everybody
What I'm about to say could mean the world's disaster
Could change your joy and laughter to tears and pain
      Love's in need of love today, don't delay, send yours in right away
      Hate's goin' 'round, breakin' many hearts. Stop it, please, before it's gone too far
The force of evil plans to make you its possession,
And it will if we let it destroy everybody
We all must take precautionary measures
If love and peace you treasure, then you'll hear me when I say
      Oh, that love's in need of love today, don't delay, send yours in right away
      Hate's goin' 'round, breakin' many hearts. Stop it, please, before it's gone too far
      People, you know that love's in need of love today, don't delay, send yours in right away
      You know that hate's goin' 'round, breakin' many hearts. Stop it, please, before it's gone too far

LOVE YOU MADLY
Love you madly, right or wrong, sounds like the lyrics of a song
But since it's so, I thought you ought to know, I love you, love you madly

"Better fish are in the sea" is not the theory for me
And that's for sure, just like I said before, I love you, love you madly.
	If you could see the happy you and me I dream about so proudly
	You'd know the breath of spring that makes me sing my love song so loudly.
Good things come to those who wait, so just relax and wait for fate
To let me see the day you say with me, I love you, love you madly

LOVING YOU HAS MADE ME BANANAS
Oh, your red scarf matches your eyes, you close your cover before striking.
Your father has the shipfitter's blues, loving you has made me bananas. (Repeat)
 	You burned your finger that evening, while my back was turned.
	I asked the waiter for iodine, but I dined all alone.  (Repeat 1st verse)

LUCKY LIPS
For women:
When I was just a little girl with long and silky curls
My Mama told me, "Honey, you've got more than other girls.
Now, you may not be good-looking, but you'll soon wear diamond clips
And you'll never have to worry 'cause you've got lucky lips."

For men:
When I was just a little baby, I didn't have many toys,
But my mama used to say, "Son, you've got more than other boys.
Now you may not be good lookin', and you may not be too rich.
But you'll never ever be alone, 'cause you've got lucky lips.

   Women and men:
	Lucky lips are always kissin', lucky lips are never blue.
	Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips that will be true.
	I don't need a four-leaf clover, rabbit's foot or good luck charms.
	With lucky lips I'll always have a baby/fella in my arms
I never get heartbroken, no, I'll never get the blues
And if I play that game of love, I know I just can't lose.
When they spin that wheel of fortune, all I do is kiss my chips
And I know I've picked a winner, 'cause I've got lucky lips.
	Lucky lips are always kissin', lucky lips are never blue.
	Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips that will be true.
	I don't need a four-leaf clover, rabbit's foot or good luck charms.
	With lucky lips I'll always have a baby/fella in my arms

LUCKY, LUCKY, LUCKY ME
Lucky, lucky, lucky me, I'm a lucky son of a gun
I work eight hours, and sleep eight hours, that leaves eight hours of fun
Lucky, lucky, lucky me, even though I haven't a dime
I laugh and play in a carefree way, and I have a wonderful time
	I smile at the sun, and when daylight is done, every evening is loaded with charms
	I wish on the moon, and I whistle a tune, and I dream of a girl in my arms
Lucky, lucky, lucky me, you can kiss your worries goodbye
Through life's a chuckle, and Lady Luck'll make you as lucky as I

Lucky, lucky, lucky me, I'm a lucky son of a gun
I work eight hours, and sleep eight hours, that leaves eight hours of fun
Lucky, lucky, lucky me, even though I haven't a dime
I laugh and play in a carefree way, and I have a wonderful time
	I smile at the sun, and when daylight is done, every evening is loaded with charms
	I wish on the moon, and I whistle a tune, and I dream of a girl in my arms
Lucky, lucky, lucky me, you can kiss your worries goodbye
Through life's a chuckle, and Lady Luck'll make you as lucky as I

LUCKY TO BE ME
	I used to think it might be fun to be anyone else but me
	I thought that it would be a pleasant surprise to wake up as a couple of other guys
	But, now that I've found you, I've changed my point of view
	And now I wouldn't give a dime to be anyone else but me
What a day! Fortune smiled and came my way
Bringing love I never thought I'd see. I'm so lucky to be me
What a night! Suddenly you came in sight
Looking just the way I'd hoped you'd be, I'm so lucky to be me
	I am simply thunderstruck at the change in my luck
	Knew at once I wanted you; never dreamed you'd want me too
I'm so proud you chose me from all the crowd
There's no other guy I'd rather be, I could laugh out loud, I'm so lucky to be me

LULLABY AND GOODNIGHT
Lullaby and goodnight, with roses bedight. With lilies o'er-spread is baby's wee bed
Lay thee down now and rest, may thy slumbers be blessed,
Lay thee down now and rest, may thy slumbers be blessed,
Lullaby and goodnight, thy mother's delight, bright angels beside my darling abide
	They will guard thee at rest, thou shalt wake on my breast
	They will guard thee at rest, thou shalt wake on my breast.
Guten Abend, gut' Nacht, mit Rosen bedacht
Mit Näglein besteckt, schlupf unter die Deck'
Morgen früh, wenn Gott will, wirst du wieder geweckt
Morgen früh, wenn Gott will, wirst du wieder geweckt

Guten Abend, gut' Nacht, von Englein be-wacht
Die zeigen im Traum, dir Christkindleins Baum
Schlaf nun selig und süss, schau im Traum's Para-dies
Schlaf nun selig und süss, schau im Traum's Para-dies

LULLABY IN RAGTIME
Won't you play the music so the cradle can rock to a lullaby in ragtime
Sleepy hands are creeping to the end of the clock, play a lullaby in ragtime
You can tell the sandman is on his way by the way that they play
As still as the trill of a thrush at twilight's hush
So you can hear the rhythm of the ripples on the side of the boat as you sail away to dreamland
High above the moon you hear a silvery note as the sandman takes your hand
So rock-a-bye my baby, don't you cry my baby, sleepy time is nigh
Won't you rock me to a ragtime lullaby.

LULLABY OF BIRDLAND
Lullaby of birdland that's what I always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland could there be ways to reveal in a phrase how I feel!
Have you ever heard two turtle doves bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we make with our lips when we kiss.
	And there's a weepy old willow, he really knows how to cry.
	That's how I'd cry on my pillow if you should tell me farewell and good-bye!
Lullaby of birdland whisper low, kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in birdland, high in the sky, flyin' high in birdland, high in the sky,
Flyin' high in birdland, high in the sky up above, 'cause we're in love.

LULLABY OF BROADWAY
Come on along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway.
The hip hooray and bally hoo, the lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of the subway train, the rattle of the taxis
The daffydils who entertain at Angelo's and Maxie's.
When a Broadway baby says good night, it's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight until the dawn
	Good night, baby, good night, milkman's on his way.
	Sleep tight, baby. Sleep tight, let's call it a day, HEY!
Come on along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway.
The hip hooray and bally hoo, the lullaby of Broadway
The band begins to go to town, and everyone goes crazy
You rock-a-bye your baby 'round 'til everything gets hazy.
Hush a bye, I'll buy you this and that, you hear a daddy saying
And baby goes home to her flat to sleep all day
	Good night, baby, good night, milkman's on his way.
	Sleep tight, baby. Sleep tight, let's call it a day!
	Listen to the lullaby of old Broadway.

LULLABY OF THE LEAVES
Cradle me where southern skies can watch me with a million eyes
Oh, sing me to sleep, lullaby of the leaves
Cover me with heaven's blue and let me dream a dream or two
Oh, sing me to sleep, lullaby of the leaves.
I'm breezing along, along with the breeze,
I'm hearing a song, a song thru the trees; ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
That pine melody caressing the shore,
Familiar to me, I've heard it before; ooh ooh that's South-land
Don't I feel it  in my soul, and don't I know I've reached my goal,
Oh, sing me to sleep, sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep, lullaby of the leaves.

LYDIA THE TATTOOED LADY
Oh, Lydia, oh! Lydia, say have you met Lydia, Lydia, the tattooed lady
She has eyes that men adore so, and a torso even more so
Lydia, oh! Lydia, that "Encyclopedia," oh! Lydia, the Queen of tattoo
On her back is the Battle of Waterloo, beside it the Wreck of the Hesperus too
And proudly above waves the Red, White and Blue, you can learn a lot from Lydia
     La la la La la la La la la La la la
When her robe is unfurled, she will show you the world, if you step up and tell her where
For a dime you can see Kankakee or Paree, or Washington crossing the Delaware
     La la la La la la La la la La la la
Oh, Lydia, oh! Lydia, say have you met Lydia, oh! Lydia, the tattooed lady
When her muscles start relaxin', up the hill comes Andrew Jackson
Lydia, oh! Lydia, that "Encyclopedia," oh! Lydia, the queen of them all
For two bits she will do a Mazurka in Jazz, with a view of Niagara that nobody has
And on a clear day you can see Alcatraz, you can learn a lot from Lydia.
     La la la La la la La la la La la la
Come along and see Buffalo Bill with his lasso, just a little classic by Mendel Picasso
Here is Captain Spaulding exploring the Amazon, here's Godiva, but with her pajamas on
     La la la La la la La la la La la la
Oh, Lydia, oh! Lydia, that encyclopedia, oh! Lydia, the champ of them all
She once swept an Admiral clear off his feet, the ships on her hips made his heart skip a beat
And now the old boy's in command of the fleet, for he went and married Lydia
I said Lydia, he said Lydia, I said Lydia, he said Lydia!

LYIN' EYES
City girls just seem to find out early, how to open doors with just a smile.
A rich old man, and she won't have to worry, she'll dress up all in lace, and go in style.
Late at night a big old house gets lonely, I guess every form of refuge has its price.
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only given to a man with hands as cold as ice.
So she tells him she must go out for the evening, to comfort an old friend, who's feeling down.
But he knows where she's going as she's leaving, she is headed for the cheatin' side of town.
 	CHORUS:
  	You can't hide your lyin' eyes, and your smile is a thin disguise.
 	I thought by now you'd realize there ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes.
On the other side of town a boy is waiting, with fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal.
She drives on through the night anticipating, 'cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel.
She rushes to his arms, they fall together, she whispers that it's only for a while.
She swears that soon she'll be coming back for ever, she pulls away and leaves him with a smile.
  	CHORUS
She gets up and pours herself a strong one, and stares out at the stars up in the sky,
Another night, it's gonna be a long one, she draws the shade and hangs her head to cry.
She wonders how it ever got this crazy, she thinks about a boy she knew in school.
Did she get tired, or did she just get lazy? She's so far gone she feels just like a fool.
My oh my, you sure know how to arrange things, you set it up so well, so carefully.
Ain't it funny how your life didn't change things, you're still the same old girl you used to be.
  	You can't hide your lyin' eyes, and your smile is a thin disguise.
  	I thought by now you'd realize there ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes.
	There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes.
	Funny, you can't hide your lyin' eyes.

MA CHERIE AMOUR
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
Ma Cherie Amour, lovely as a summer's day
Ma Cherie Amour, distant as the Milky Way
Ma Cherie Amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never notice me
My Cherie Amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

Maybe someday you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, Cherie Amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

La la la la la la
La la la la la la

MACK THE KNIFE
Oh, the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has old Mac-heath, babe, and he keeps it out of sight

You know, when that shark bites with his teeth, babe, scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though, wears old Mac-heath, babe, so there's never, never a trace of red

Now on the sidewalk, ooh, sunny morning, uh-huh, lies a body just oozin' life
And someone's sneakin' 'round the corner. Could that someone be Mack the Knife?

There's a tugboat down by the river, don't ya know, where a cement bag's just a-droopin' on down
Oh, that ce-ment is just, it's there for the weight, dear, five'll get ya ten, old Macky's back in town

Now d'ya hear about Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe, after drawin' out all his hard-earned cash
And now Mac-heath spends just like a sailor. Could it be our boy's done something rash?

Now Jenny Diver, ho, ho, yeah, Sukey Tawdry, ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, babe, now that Macky's back in town

I said Jenny Diver, whoa, Sukey Tawdry, look out to Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe, now that Macky's.................
Back in town. Look out ol' Macky is back!

MAGIC MOMENTS
	Magic moments, when two hearts are caring
	Magic moments, memories we've been sharing
I'll never forget the moment we kissed the night of the hay ride
The way that we hugged to try to keep warm while takin' the sleigh ride
	Magic moments, memories we've been sharing
	Magic moments, when two hearts are caring
     Time can't erase the memory of these magic moments filled with love
The telephone call that tied up the line for hours and hours
The Saturday dance I got up the nerve to send you some flowers
	Magic moments, memories we've been sharing
	Magic moments, when two hearts are caring
     Time can't erase the memory of these magic moments filled with love
 (The way that we cheered whenever our team was scoring a touchdown)
The time that the floor fell out of my car when I put the clutch down
(The penny arcade, the games that we played, the fun and the prizes)
The Halloween hop when everyone came in funny disguises
Magic moments filled with love

THE MAGIC TOUCH
You-oo-'ve got the magic touch, it makes me glow so much
It casts a spell, it rings a bell, the magic touch

Oh-uh-oh, when I feel your charm, it's like a fourth alarm
You make me thrill so much, you've got the magic touch
	If I go reeling, uh-oh, I'm feeling the glow. But where can I go from you
I didn't know too much, and then I felt your touch
And now I've learned I can return the magic touch
	If I go reeling, uh-oh, I'm feeling the glow. But where can I go from you
I didn't know too much, and then I felt your touch
And now I've learned I can return the magic touch

MAIRZY DOATS
Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?
Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?
If the words sound queer and funny to your ear
A little bit jumbled and jivey
Sing "Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivey"
Mairzy doats and dozey doats and liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you, oh yeh,(X2)  A kiddley divey too, wooden  shoe?

MAKE IT EASY ON YOURSELF
	Make it easy on yourself, make it easy on yourself,
	Oh, breaking up is so very hard to do
If you really love him,  and there's nothing I can do
Don't try to spare my feelings, just tell me that we're through
	And make it easy on yourself, make it easy on yourself
	'Cause breaking up is so very hard to do
And if the way I hold you can't compare to his caress
No words of consolation will make me miss you less
	My darling, if this is goodbye, I just know I'm gonna cry
	So run to him, before you start crying too

	And make it easy on yourself, make it easy on yourself
	'Cause breaking up is so very hard to do

MAKE IT WITH YOU
Hey, have you ever tried really reaching out for the other side
I may be climbing on rainbows, but, baby, here goes

Dreams, they're for those who sleep, life is for us to keep
And if you're wondering what this song is leading to
I want to make it with you, I really think that we could make it, girl

No, you don't know me well, in every little thing, only time will tell
But you believe the things that I do, and we'll see it through

Life can be short or long, love can be right or wrong
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through, I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girl

Baby, you know that dreams, they're for those who sleep, life is for us to keep
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through, I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girl

MAKE SOMEONE HAPPY
Make someone happy, make just one someone happy
Make just one heart the heart you sing to
One smile that cheers you, one face that lights when it nears you
One man you're everything to
Fame, if you win it, comes and goes in a minute
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to?
Love is the answer, someone to love is the answer.
Once you've found him, build your world around him.
Make someone happy, make just one someone happy, and you will be happy too.

MAKE THE WORLD GO AWAY
	Make the world go away, and get if off my shoulders
	Say the things you used to say, and make the world go away
Do you remember when you loved me, before the world took me astray
If you do, then forgive me, and make the world go away
	Make the world go away, and get if off my shoulders
	Say the things you used to say, and make the world go away
I'm sorry if I hurt you, I'll make it up, day by day
Just say you love me like you used to, and make the world go away
	Make the world go away, and get if off my shoulders
	Say the things you used to say, and make the world go away
	Say the things you used to say, and make the world go away

MAKE YOUR OWN KIND OF MUSIC
Nobody can tell you, "There's only one song worth singing."
They may try and sell you, 'cause it hangs them up to see someone like you.
	But you've got to make your own kind of music, sing your own special song
	Make your own kind of music, even if nobody else sings along
You're gonna be nowhere, the loneliest kind of lonely
It may be rough going, just to do your thing's the hardest thing to do
	But you've got to make your own kind of music, sing your own special song
	Make your own kind of music, even if nobody else sings along
So, if you cannot take my hand, and if you must be goin', I will understand
	But you've got to make your own kind of music, sing your own special song
	Make your own kind of music, even if nobody else sings along

MAKIN' WHOOPEE
Another bride, another June, another sunny honeymoon,
Another season, another reason for makin' whoopee
A lot of shoes, a lot of rice, the groom is nervous, he answers twice
It's really killing, that he's so willing to make whoopee.
	Picture a little love-nest, down where the roses cling
	Picture the same sweet love-nest, think what a year can bring
He's washing dishes and baby clothes, he's so ambitious, he even sews
But don't forget folks, that's what you get, folks, for makin' whoopee!
Another year or maybe less, what's this I hear? Well, can't you guess?
She feels neglected and he's suspected of makin' whoopee
She sits alone most every night, he doesn't phone her, he doesn't write
He says he's "busy," but she says "is he?" He's makin' whoopee!
	He doesn't make much money, only six thousand per
	Some judge who thinks he's funny says "You'll pay six to her."
He says now Judge, suppose I fail? The judge says "Budge right into jail.
You'd better keep her, I think it's cheaper than makin whoopee!

MAMA LOOK A BOO-BOO
	I wonder why nobody don't like me, or is it the fact that I'm ugly
	I wonder why nobody don't like me, or is it the fact that I'm ugly
I leave my whole house and go, my children don't want me no more
Bad talk inside the house they bring, and when I talk they start to sing
	Mama, look at bubu, they shout, their mother tell them "shut up your mouth.
	That is your daddy." Oh, no, my daddy can't be ugly so.
		Shut your mout, go away, mama look at bubu dey
		Shut your mout, go away, mama look at bubu dey
I couldn't even digest me supper, due to the children's behavior
John, (yes pa), come here a moment, bring de belt, you're much too impudent
John says it's James who start it first, James tells de story in reverse
I drag me belt from off me waist, you should hear dem screamin' 'round de place
	Mama, look at bubu, they shout, their mother tell them "shut up your mouth.
	That is your daddy." Oh, no, my daddy can't be ugly so.
		Shut your mout, go away, mama look at bubu dey
		Shut your mout, go away, mama look at bubu dey
So, I began to question de mother, "These children ain't got no behavior
So, I began to question de mother, "These children ain't got no behavior
"They're playing with you," my wife declared, "You should be proud of them, my dear."
Them children were taught too bloomin' slack, that ain't no kind of joke to crack
	Mama, look at bubu, they shout, their mother tell them "shut up your mouth.
	That is your daddy." Oh, no, my daddy can't be ugly so.
		Shut your mout, go away, mama look at bubu dey
		Shut your mout, go away, mama look at bubu dey

MAMA SAID
Mama said there'll be days like this, there'll be days like this Mama said (Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this, there'll be days like this my Mama said (Mama said, mama said)
I went walking the other day, everything was going fine,

Mama said there'll be days like this, there'll be days like this Mama said (Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this, there'll be days like this my Mama said

Mama said there'll be days like this, there'll be days like this my Mama said

MAM'SELLE
It was Montmartre
It was midnight Come to think of it
It was spring
There was music I was listening
Then in the room somewhere someone began to sing
This serenade made for remembering

A small Cafe, Mam'selle, our rendezvous, Mam'selle.
The violins were warm and sweet, and so were you Mam'selle.
And as the night danced by, a kiss became a sigh,
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way that mine does for you.
And yet I know too well someday you'll say goodbye,
Then violins will cry, and so will I Mam'selle.

A MAN AND A WOMAN
When hearts are passing in the night, in the lonely night
Then they must hold each other tight, oh, so very tight
And take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light
They'll stay together, so much in love

And in the silence of a mist, of a morning mist
When lips are waiting to be kissed, longing to be kissed
Where is the reason to resist and deny a kiss
That holds a promise of happiness?
	Though yesterday still surrounds you with a warm and precious memory
	Maybe for tomorrow we can build a new dream for you and me
This glow we feel is something rare, something really rare
So come and say you want to share, want to really share
The beauty waiting for us there, calling for us there
That only loving can give the heart

When life is passing in the night, in the rushing night
A man, a woman in the night, in the lonely night
Must take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light
They'll be together, so much in love, together, so much in love
So tell me
You're not afraid to take a chance, really take a chance
Let your heart begin to dance, let it sing and dance
To the music of a glance, of a fleeting glance
To the music of romance, of a new romance, take a chance

MANHATTAN
	Summer journeys to Niagara and to other places
	Aggravate all our cares, we'll save our fares
	I've a cozy little flat in what is known as old Manhattan
	We'll settle down right here in town
We'll have Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island too
It's lovely going through the zoo
It's very fancy on old Delancy Street, you know
The subway charms us so, when balmy breezes blow to and fro
And tell me what street compares with Mott Street in July?
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by
The great big city's a wondrous toy just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

MAN OF CONSTANT SORROW
I am a man of zzx;'XC"constant sorrow, I've seen trouble all my days
I'm going back to California, place where I was partly raised

All through this world I'm bound to ramble, through storm and wind, through sleet and rain
I'm bound to ride that northern railroad, perhaps I'll take the very next train

Your friends they say I am a stranger, you'll never see my face no more
There is just one promise that's given, we'll sail on God's golden shore

I am a man of constant sorrow, I've seen trouble all my days
I'm going back to California, place where I was partly raised

MARGARITAVILLE
Nibblin' on sponge cake, watchin' the sun bake, all of those tourists all covered with oil
Strummin' my four-string on my front porch swing, smell those shrimp they're beginnin' to boil
	Wastin' away again in Margaritaville, searching for my lost shaker of salt
	Some people claim that there's a woman to blame, but I know it's nobody's fault.
I don't know the reason I stayed here all season, nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty, a Mexican cutie, how it got here I haven't a clue.
	CHORUS                 ending:   "hell, it could be my fault"
I blew out my flip-flop, stepped on a pop-top, cut my heel, had to cruise on back home
But there's booze in the blender and soon it will render, that frozen concoction that helps me hang on.
	CHORUS	          ending:  "and I know, it's my own damned fault"

MARGIE
You may talk about your love affair. Here's one I'd like to tell to you
All night long they sit upon the stairs. He holds her close, and starts a tune........

My little Margie, I'm always thinkin' of you, Margie, I'll tell the world I love you
Don't forget your promise to me, 'cause I have bought the home, and ring and everything
For Margie, you've been my inspiration, days are never blue
After all is said and done, Sweetie, there is only one. oh, Margie, Margie, it's you.

MARIANNE
	All day, all night, Marianne, down by the sea-side, siftin' sand
	Even little children love Marianne, down by the sea-side, siftin' sand
Marianne, oh, Marianne, oh, won't you marry me?
We can have a bamboo hut, with brandy in the sea
Leave your fat old mama home, she never will say yes,
If mama don't know now, she can guess  (my, my, yes!)
	All day, all night, Marianne........
When she walks along the shore, people pause to greet,
White birds fly around her, little fish come to her feet
In her heart is love, but I'm the only mortal man
Who's allowed to kiss my...Marianne (don't rush me!)
	All day, all night, Marianne........
When we marry, we will have a time you never saw,
I will be so happy, I will kiss me mother-in-law (phooey!)
Children by the dozen, in and out of bamboo hut,
One for every palm tree and cokey-nut. (hurry up now!)
	All day, all night, Marianne........

MARIE
Marie, the dawn is breaking. Marie, you'll soon be waking
To find your heart is aching, and tears will fall as you recall
The moon in all its splendor, the kiss, so very tender
The words will you surrender to me, Marie

MARINES' HYMN
From the Halls of Montezuma, to the shores of Tripoli
We fight our country's battles in the air, on land, and sea;
First to fight for right and freedom, and to keep our honor clean;
We are proud to claim the title of United States Marine.

THE MARVELOUS TOY
When I was just a wee little lad full of health and joy,
My father homeward came one night and gave to me a toy.
A wonder to behold, it was, with many colors bright,
And the moment I laid eyes on it, it became my heart's delight.
	It went "zip" when it moved and "bop" when it stopped,
	And "whirr" when it stood still.
	I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will.
The first time that I picked it up, I had a big sur-prise,
For right on its bottom were two big buttons that looked like big green eyes.
I first pushed one and then the other, and then I twisted its lid,
And when I set it down again, this is what it did:
	It went "zip"...........
It first marched left and then marched right, and then marched under a chair.
And when l looked where it had gone, it wasn't even there.
I started to cry and my daddy laughed, for he knew that I would find,
When l turned around, my marvelous toy, chugging from be-hind.
	It went "zip" ...........
Well, the years have gone by too quickly, it seems, I have my own little boy.
And yesterday I gave to him my marvelous little toy.
His eyes nearly popped right out of his head, and he gave a squeal of glee.
Neither one of us knows just what it is, but he loves it, just like me.
	It still goes "zip" .........

THE MARY ELLEN CARTER
She went down last October in a pouring driving rain.
The skipper, he'd been drinking and the Mate, he felt no pain.
Too close to Three Mile Rock, and she was dealt her mortal blow,
And the Mary Ellen Carter settled low.
There were just us five aboard her when she finally was awash.
We'd worked like hell to save her, all heedless of the cost.
And the groan she gave as she went down, it caused us to proclaim
That the Mary Ellen Carter would rise again.

Well, the owners wrote her off; not a nickel would they spend.
She gave twenty years of service, boys, then met her sorry end.
But insurance paid the loss to us, they let her rest below.
Then they laughed at us and said we had to go.
But we talked of her all winter, some days around the clock,
For she's worth a quarter million, afloat and at the dock.
And with every jar that hit the bar, we swore we would remain
And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again.

Rise again, rise again, that her name not be lost to the knowledge of men.
Those who loved her best and were with her till the end
Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again.

All spring, now, we've been with her on a barge lent by a friend.
Three dives a day in hard hat suit and twice I've had the bends.
Thank God it's only sixty feet and the currents here are slow
Or I'd never have the strength to go below.
But we've patched her rents, stopped her vents, dogged hatch and porthole down.
Put cables to her, 'fore and aft and girded her around.
Tomorrow, noon, we hit the air and then take up the strain.
And make the Mary Ellen Carter Rise Again.

For we couldn't leave her there, you see, to crumble into scale.
She'd saved our lives so many times, living through the gale
And the laughing, drunken rats who left her to a sorry grave
They won't be laughing in another day. . .
And you, to whom adversity has dealt the final blow
With smiling bastards lying to you everywhere you go
Turn to, and put out all your strength of arm and heart and brain
And like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again.

Rise again, rise again - though your heart it be broken, and life about to end
No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend.
Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again.

MATTER OF TRUST
Some love is just a lie of the heart, the cold remains of what began with a passionate start
And they may not want it to end, but it will, it's just a question of when
I've lived long enough to have learned the closer you get to the fire the more you get burned
But that won't happen to us, 'cause it's always been a matter of trust

I know you're an emotional girl. It took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world
I can't offer you proof, but you're gonna face a moment of truth
It's hard when you're always afraid, you just recover when another belief is betrayed
So break my heart if you must, it's a matter of trust
	You can't go the distance with too much resistance
	I know you have doubts, but for God's sake, don't shut me out
This time you've got nothing to lose, you can take it, you can leave it, whatever you choose
I won't hold back any-thing, and I'll walk away a fool or a king
Some love is just a lie of the mind. It's make believe until it's only a matter of time
And some might have learned to adjust, but then it never was a matter of trust
	I'm sure you're aware, love, we've both had our share of
	Believing too long, when the whole situation was wrong
Some love is just a lie of the soul, a constant battle for the ultimate state of control
After you've heard lie upon lie, there can hardly be a question of why
Some love is just a lie of the heart, the cold remains of what began with a passionate start
But that can't happen to us, 'cause it's always been a matter of trust
	It's a matter of trust        (repeat and fade)

MAXWELL'S SILVER HAMMER
Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test-tube,oh, oh, oh, oh!
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Jo-o-o-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go, a knock comes on the door
	Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
	Blang, blang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead.
Back in  school again, Maxwell plays the fool again, teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene.
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away, so he waits behind.
Writing fifty times, I must not be so-o-o-o.
But when she turns her back on the boy, he creeps up from behind.
           Bang, bang..................
	Silver Hammer, ooooo oooooo!
P. C. Thirty-One said, "We've caught a dirty one." Maxwell stands alone,
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery, say he must go free
The judge does not agree, and he tells them so-o-o-o.
But as the words are leaving his lips, a noise comes from behind.
	Bang, bang.....................
	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.......

MAYBE, BABY
Maybe, baby, I'll have you. Maybe, baby, you'll be true.
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me
It's funny, honey, you don't care, you never listen to my prayer.
Maybe, baby, you will love me someday.
	Well, you are the one that makes me glad, any other one that makes me sad
	And when someday that you want me, well, I'll  be there, wait and see!
Maybe, baby, I'll have you. Maybe, baby, you'll be true.
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me
  Instrumental
	Well, you are the one that makes me glad, any other one that makes me sad
	And when someday that you want me, well, I'll  be there, wait and see!
Maybe, baby, I'll have you. Maybe, baby, you'll be true.
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me,  maybe, baby, I'll have you for me

MAYBE THIS TIME
Maybe this time, I'll be lucky, maybe this time she'll stay
Maybe this time, for the first time, love won't hurry away
She will hold me fast, I'll be home at last
Not a loser anymore, like the last time, and the time before

Everybody loves a winner, so nobody loved me
"Mister Peaceful," "Mister Happy," that's what I long to be
All the odds are in my favor, something's bound to begin
It's got to happen, happen sometime. Maybe this time I'll win

MAYBE YOU'LL BE THERE
Each time I see a crowd of people, just like a fool, I stop and stare
It's really not the proper thing to do, but maybe you'll be there
I go out walking after midnight, along the lonely thoroughfare
It's not the time or place to look for you, but maybe you'll be there
	You said your arms would always hold me
	You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
	Now, after all those things you told me, how could it end like this?
Someday, if all my prayers are answered, I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart, I'll hurry to the door, and maybe you'll be there

MAY YOU ALWAYS
May you always walk in sunshine, slumber warm when night winds blow
May you always live with laughter, for a smile becomes you so
May good fortune find your doorway, may the bluebird sing your song
May no trouble travel your way, may no worry stay too long
	May your heartaches be forgotten, may no tears be spilled
	May auld acquaintance be remembered, and your cup of kindness filled
And may always be a dreamer, may your wildest dream come true
May you find someone to love, as much as I love you
May you find someone to love, as much as I love you

McDONALD'S IS YOUR KIND OF PLACE
(sung to the tune of "Down By the Riverside")
McDonald's is your kind of place, hamburgers in your face
French fries up your nose, mustard between your toes
The last time that I ate there, they stole my underwear
McDonald's is the place for me

ME AND JULIO DOWN BY THE SCHOOLYARD
The mama pajama rolled out of bed, and she ran to the police station
When the papa found out, he began to shout, and he started the investigation
It's against the law, it was against the law, what the mama saw, it was against the law

The mama looked down and spit on the ground every time my name gets mentioned
The papa said, "oy, if I get that boy, I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention"
	Well, I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
	I'm on my way, I'm taking my time, but I don't know where
	Goodbye, Rosie, the Queen of Corona
	Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
	Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Whoa, in a couple days they come and take me away, but the press let the story leak
And when the radical priest come to get me released, we was all on the cover of Newsweek
	And, I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
	I'm on my way, I'm taking my time, but I don't know where
	Goodbye, Rosie, the Queen of Corona
	Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
	Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
	Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard

ME AND MY ARROW
Me and my arrow, straighter than narrow
Wherever we go, everyone knows it's me and my arrow
Me and my arrow, taking the high road
Wherever we go, everyone knows it's me and my arrow
	And in the morning when I wake up, she may be gone, I don't know
	And if we make up just to break up, I'll carry on, oh yes I will
Me and my arrow, do do do do do do do do, straighter than narrow
Wherever we go, everyone knows it's me and my arrow
	Me and my arrow.....me and my arrow
	Me and my arrow, me and my arrow, me and my arrow
Me and my arrow, do do do do do do do do, straighter than narrow
Wherever we go, everyone knows it's me and my arrow

ARE YOU SLEEPING
Are you sleeping? Can you hear me? Do you know if I am by your side?
Does it matter if you hear me? When the morning comes I'll be there by your side
	And in the morning when I wake up, she may be telling me goodbye, la la la la
	And in the evening if we break up, I'm wondering why, I'm wondering why
There was a time, we had a time, there was a time, we had a time
There was a time, there was a time when you were mine
We had a time, we had a time, we had a time, oh what a time
There was a time, there was a time when you were mine
	And in the evening if we go out, night time will find us at the show, la la la la
	Or we may decide to stay inside, you never know, you never know, etc.
Are you sleeping or can you hear me? Do you know if I am by your side?
Does it matter if you hear me? When the morning comes I'll be there by your side
Na, na, na...........(fade)

ME AND MY SHADOW
Me and my shadow, strolling down the avenue. Me and my shadow, not a soul to tell our troubles to
	And when it's twelve o'clock we climb the stair, we never knock, for nobody's there,
Just me and my shadow, all alone and feeling blue.

MEAN OL' MOON
Mean ol' moon, it must be fun to shine upon me, as I come undone
'Til I'm all alone, beneath the sun, you mean ol' moon

With your beam, you led the way, and found me love I though was here to stay
Then you went and took my love away, you mean ol' moon
	Oh, you mean ol' stars above, the games that you play with me
	I could find some happiness, if all my nights were cloudy
Mean ol' moon, I hope it's true, you're taking all the light that's left in you
And saving it up for you know who, you mean ol' moon, you mean ol' moon.

ME, MYSELF, AND I
Me, myself, and I are all in love with you.
We all think you're wonderful, we do.
Me, myself, and I have just one point of view.
We're convinced there's no one else like you.
	It can't be denied, dear, you brought the sun to us
	We'd be satisfied, dear, if you, you'd belong to one of us.
So if you pass me by three hearts will break in two,
'Cause me, myself, and I are all in love with you.

MEDITATION
In my loneliness, when you're gone and I'm all by myself and I need your caress
I just think of you, and the thought of you holding me near makes my loneliness soon disappear
Though you're far away, I have only to close my eyes and you are back to stay
I just close my eyes, and the sadness that missing you brings
Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings
	Yes, I love you so, and that for me is all I need to know
I will wait for you 'til the sun falls from out of the sky, for what else can I do?
I will wait for you, meditating how sweet life will be when you come back to me
Meditating how sweet life will be when you come back to me.

MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, LOUIS
When Louis came home to the flat, he hung up his coat and his hat
He gazed all around but no wifey he found, so he said "where can Flossy be at?"
A note on the table he spied, he read it just once then he cried.
It read "Louis, dear, it's too slow for me here, so I think I will go for a ride."
	Meet me in Saint Louis, Louis, meet me at the fair.
	Don't tell me the lights are shining any place but there.
	We will dance the hoochie koochie, I will be your tootsie wootsie.
	If you will meet me in Saint Louis, Louis, meet me at the fair.
The dresses that hung in the hall were gone, she had taken them all
She took all his rings and the rest of his things; the picture he missed from the wall
"What! moving!" the janitor said, "Your rent is paid three months ahead."
"What good is the flat?" said poor Louis, "Read that." And the janitor smiled as he read....
	(Meet me.....)

MELE KALIKIMAKA

A very Merry Christmas, a very, very, Merry, Merry Chistmas to you.

MEMORIES ARE MADE OF THIS
Take one fresh and  tender kiss, add one stolen night of bliss,
One girl, one boy, some grief, some joy. Memo-ries are made of this.

Don't forget a small moonbeam. Fold it lightly with a dream.
Your lips and mine, two sips of wine. Memories are made of this.
	Then add the wedding bells,   one house where lovers dwell, three little kids for the flavor.
	Stir carefully through the days, see how the flavor stays. These are the dreams you will savor.
With His blessings from above, serve it generously with love.
One man, one wife, one love, through life.
Memories are made of this. Memories are made of this.

MEMORIES OF YOU
Waking skies at sun-rise, every sunset too, seems to be bringing me memories of you
Here and there, everywhere, scenes that we once knew, and they all just recall memories of you
	How I wish I could forget those happy yesteryears that have left a rosary of tears
Your face beams in my dreams 'spite of all I do. Everything seems to bring memories of you.

MERCHANT MARINES ANTHEM (HEAVE HO, MY LADS, HEAVE HO)
Heave Ho! My Lads, Heave Ho! It's a long, long way to go.
It's a long, long pull with our hatches full,
Braving the wind, braving the sea, fighting the treacherous foe;
Heave Ho! My lads, Heave Ho! Let the sea roll high or low.
We can cross any ocean, sail any river. Give us the goods and we'll deliver,
Damn the submarine! We're the men of the Merchant Marine!

COAST GUARD MARCHING SONG (SEMPER PARATUS)
	From Aztec Shore to Arctic Zone, to Europe and Far East,
	The Flag is carried by our ships, in times of war and peace;
	And never have we struck it yet, in spite of foeman's might.
	Who cheered our crews and cheered again, for showing how to fight.
So here's the Coast Guard marching song, we sing on land and sea.
Through surf and storm and howling gale, high shall our purpose be.
"Semper Paratus" is our guide, our fame and glory too.
To fight to save or fight and die, aye! Coast Guard we are for you.

MICHELLE
Michelle, ma belle, these are words that go together well, my Michelle
Michelle, ma belle, sont les mots qui vont très bien ensemble, très bien ensemble
	I love you, I love you, I love you, that's all I want to say
	Until I find a way, I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
Michelle, ma belle, sont les mots qui vont très bien ensemble, très bien ensemble
	I need to, I need to, I need to, I need to make you see, oh what you mean to me
	Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
I love you
	I want you, I want you, I want you, I think you know by now
	I'll get to you somehow. Until I do, I'm telling you, so you'll understand
Michelle, ma belle, sont les mots qui vont très bien ensemble, très bien ensemble
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand, my Michelle

MIDNIGHT SPECIAL
Well, you wake up in the mornin', you hear the work bell ring
And they march you to the table, you see the same damned thing
Ain't no food upon the table, and no pork up in the pan
But you better not complain, boy, you get in trouble with the man
	Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
	Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
	Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
	Let the Midnight Special shine a everlovin' light on me
Yonder come Miss Rosie, how in the world did you know?
By the way she wears her apron, and the clothes she wore
Umbrella on her shoulder, piece of paper in her hand
She come to see the gov'nor, she wants to free her man
	 CHORUS
If you're ever in Houston, well, you better do right
You better not gamble, and you better not fight,
Or the sheriff will arrest you, and the boys will bring you down
The next thing you know, boy, You're penitentiary bound
	CHORUS

MIDNIGHT SUN
Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice, warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace, rising to a snowy height
Each star its own aurora borealis, suddenly you held me tight
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me, or was that a moonlit veil
The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale
And then your arms miraculously found me, suddenly the sky turned pale
I could see the midnight sun
	Was there such a night, it's a thrill I still don't quite believe
	But, after you were gone, there was still  some stardust on my sleeve
The flame of it may dwindle to an ember, and the stars forget to shine
And we may see the meadow in December, icy white and crystalline
But, oh, my darling always I'll remember, when your lips were close to mine
And I saw the midnight sun

MIDNIGHT, THE STARS AND YOU
Midnight with the stars and you, midnight and a rendez-vous
Your eyes held a message tender, saying "I surrender all my love to you"
Midnight brought us sweet romance, I know all my whole life through
I'll be remembering you, whatever else I do, midnight with the stars and you

MISTER SANDMAN
Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom, etc.
Mis....ter...Sandman, bring me a dream, make his complexion like peaches and cream
Give her two lips like roses and clover, then tell me that my lonesome nights are over
Sandguy, I'm so alone, ain't got nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam, Mr. Sandman bring me a dream.

Mr. Sandman, YESSSSS..... bring me a dream,       make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him the word that I'm not a rover, then tell me that my lonesome nights are over
Sandguy, I'm so alone, ain't got nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam,
Mr. Sand-man bring me, please, please bring me,  Mr. Sand-man, bring me a  dream.
Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom, etc...Mr. Sandman

MISTY
Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud, I can't understand
I get misty just holding your hand
Walk my way, and a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello, that music I hear, I get misty the moment you're near.
You can say that you're leading me on, but it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost, that's why I'm following you.
On my own, would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left, my hat from my glove,
I'm too misty and too much in love,
I'm too misty and too much in love.

MOCKINGBIRD HILL
When the sun in the mornin' peeps over the hill
And kisses the roses 'round my windowsill
Then my heart fills with gladness when I hear the trill
Of those birds in the treetops on Mockin'bird Hill
	Tra-la-la, tweedlee dee dee it gives me a thrill
	To wake up in the morning to the mockin' bird's trill
	Tra-la-la, tweedlee dee dee, there's peace and good will -
	You're welcome as the flowers on Mockin'bird Hill
When it's late in the evenin' I climb up the hill
And survey all my kingdom while everything's still
Only me and the sky and an old whippoorwill
Singing songs in the twilight on Mockin'bird Hill
            (Repeat Refrain)
 Got a three cornered plow and an acre to till
And a mule that I bought for a ten dollar bill
There's a tumbledown shack and a rusty old mill,
But it's my home sweet home up on Mockin'bird Hill.
	(Repeat Refrain)

MOMENTS TO REMEMBER
The New Year's Eve we did the town, the day we tore the goal post down.
We will have these moments to remember.
The quiet walks, the noisy fun, the ballroom prize we almost won.
We will have these moments to remember.
	Though summer turns to winter, and the present disappears.
	The laughter we were glad to share, will echo through the years.
When other nights and other days may find us gone our separate ways.
We will have these moments to remember.
The drive-in movie where we'd go, and somehow never watched the show.
We will have these moments to remember.

MONA LISA
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you; you're so like the lady with the mystic smile.
Is it only 'cause you're lonely men have blamed you for that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa, or is this the way you hide a broken heart?
	Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep; they just lie there, and they die there.
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa, or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art. (X2)
	Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa.

MONSTER MASH
I was working in the lab late one night, when my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from the slab began to rise, and suddenly, to my surprise
He did the mash... He did the Monster Mash, The Monster Mash... It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash... It caught on in a flash,  He did the mash... He did the Monster Mash

From my laboratory in the Castle East to the Master Bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abode to get a jolt from my electrode
They did the mash... They did the Monster Mash, The monster mash... It was a graveyard smash
They did the mash... It caught on in a flash, They did the mash... They did the monster mash
　　　　The Zombies were having fun... wha-ooo, the party had just begun... wha-ooo
　　　　The guests included Wolfman...wooo, Dracula and his son..wooooo
The scene was rocking all were digging the sound, Igor on chains backed by His Baying Hounds
The Coffin Bangers were about to arrive with their vocal group, the Crypt Kicker Five
They played the mash...They played the Monster Mash, The monster mash...It was a graveyard smash
They played the mash...It caught on in a flash, They played the mash...They played the monster mash

Out from his coffin Drac's voice did ring, it seems he was troubled by just one thing
Opened the lid and shook his fist, and said "Whatever hoppened to my Transylvania Tvist?"
It's now the mash... It's now the Monster Mash, The monster mash... And it's a graveyard smash
It's now the mash... It caught on in a flash, It's now the mash... It's now the Monster Mash

Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band, and my Monster Mash, is the hit of the land
For you, the living, this Mash was meant, too, when you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you
And you can Mash... And you can Monster Mash, The monster mash... And do my graveyard Smash
Then you can Mash... You'll catch on in a flash, Then you can Mash... Then you can Monster Mash

MOOD INDIGO
You ain't been blue; no, no, no. You ain't been blue, till you've had that mood indigo.
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes, while I sit and sigh, "Go 'long blues".
	Always get that mood indigo, since my baby said goodbye.
	In the evenin' when lights are low, I'm so lonesome I could cry.
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me,
I'm just a soul who's bluer than blue can be.
When I get that mood indigo, I could lay me down and die.

MOONDANCE
Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance with the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance 'neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are falling to the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling of your heart-strings that play soft and low
And all the night's magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush
	Can I just have one a' more moondance with you, my love
	Can I just make some more romance with you, my love
Well I wanna make love to you tonight
I can't wait till the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right
And straight into my arms you will run
And when you come my heart will be waiting
To make sure you're never alone
There and then all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then I will make you my own
And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
And I know how much you want me that you can't hide
	Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love
	Can I just make some more romance with you, my love

MOONLIGHT BAY
We were sailing along on Moonlight Bay
We could hear the voices singing; they seemed to say,
"You have stolen my heart, now don't go 'way,"
As we sang love's old sweet song on Moonlight Bay.

MOONLIGHT BECOMES YOU
Moonlight becomes you, it goes with your hair
You certainly know the right thing to wear
Moonlight becomes you, I'm thrilled at the sight
And I could get so romantic tonight
	You're all dressed up to go dreaming, now don't tell me I'm wrong
	And what a night to go dreaming, mind if I tag along
And if I say: "I love you," I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight, although
Moonlight becomes you so

MOONLIGHT IN VERMONT
Pennies in a stream, falling leaves, a sycamore, moonlight in Vermont
Icy fingerwaves, ski trails on a mountainside, moonlight in Vermont
Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway and travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting are so hypnotized by the lovely
Evening summer breeze, warbling of a meadowlark, moonlight in Vermont
You and I and moonlight in Vermont

MOONLIGHT SERENADE
I stand at your gate, and the song that I sing is of moonlight,
I stand, and I wait for the touch of your hand in the June night,
The roses are sighing a moonlight serenade
The stars are aglow, and tonight how their light sets me dreaming,
My love, do you know that your eyes are like stars, brightly beaming?
I bring you, and sing you, a moonlight serenade
	Let us stray, till break of day, in love's valley of dreams
	Just you and I, a summer sky, a heavenly breeze kissing the trees
So don't let me wait, come to me, tenderly, in the June night,
I stand at your gate, and I sing you a song in the moonlight,
A love song,  my darling, a moonlight serenade.  A love song,  my darling, a moonlight serenade.

MOON OVER MIAMI
Moon over Miami, shine on my love and me, so we can stroll beside the roll of the rolling sea.
Moon over Miami, shine on as we begin,
A dream or two that may come true, when the tide comes in.
	Hark to the song of the smiling troubadours, hark to the throbbing guitars,
	Hear how the waves offer thunderous applause, after each song to the stars.
Moon over Miami, you know we're waiting for,
A little love, a little kiss, on Miami shore.

MOON RIVER
Moon  River, wider than a mile, I'm crossing you in style some day
Old dream maker, you heart breaker, wherever you're goin'  I'm  goin' your way
Two drifters, off to see the world. There's such a lot of world to see.
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend,
My Huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me.

MOONSHADOW
Oh, I'm bein' followed by a moon-shadow, moonshadow, moon-shadow
Leapin' and hoppin' on a moon-shadow, moonshadow, moon-shadow
	And if I ever lose my hands, lose my plough, lose my land,
	Oh if I ever lose my hands, Oh if-------------     I won't have to work no more.
	And if I ever lose my eyes,  if my colors all run dry,
	Yes, if I ever lose my eyes, Oh if------------- I won't have to cry no more.
Yes, I'm bein' followed by a moon-shadow, moonshadow, moon-shadow
Leapin and hoppin' on a moon-shadow, moonshadow, moon-shadow
	And if i ever lose my legs, I won't moan, and I won't beg,
	Oh, if I ever lose my legs, Oh if-------------- I won't have to walk no more
	And if I ever lose my mouth, all my teeth, north and south,
	Yes, if I ever lose my mouth, Oh if--------------I won't have to talk..
		Did it take long to find me?  I asked the faithful light.
		Oh, did it take long to find me?  And are you gonna stay the night?
I'm bein' followed by a moon-shadow, moonshadow, moon-shadow
Leapin and hoppin' on a moon-shadow, moonshadow, moon-shadow
Moonshadow, moon-shadow,  moonshadow, moon-shadow

MORE
More than the greatest love the world has known. This is the love I'll give to you alone.
More than the simple words I try to say. I only live to love you more each day
	More than you'll ever know, my arms long to hold you so
	My life will be in your keeping, waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping.
Longer than always is a long, long time. But far beyond forever you'll be mine.
I know I never lived before and my heart is very sure no one else could love you more.

MORE I CANNOT WISH YOU
Velvet, I can wish you for the collar of your coat, and fortune smiling all along your way
But more I cannot wish you than to wish you find your love, your own true love this day.
Mansions, I can wish you, seven footmen all in red, and calling cards upon a silver tray
But more I cannot wish you than to wish you find your love, your own true love this day.
	Standing there, gazing at you, full of the bloom of youth
	Standing there, gazing at you, with a sheep's eye and a licorice tooth.
Music, I can wish you, merry music while you're young
And wisdom when your hair has turned to gray
But more I cannot wish you than to wish you find your love, your own true love this day.
With a sheep's eye and a licorice tooth, and the strong arms to carry you away.

THE MORE I SEE YOU
     Each time I look at you is like the first time, each time you're near me, the thrill is new;
     And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for the rare delight of the sight of you,  for...
The more I see you, the more I want you; somehow this feeling just grows and grows.
With every sigh, I become more mad about you, more lost without you, and so it goes.

Can you  imagine how much I love you, the more I see you as years go by?
I know the only one for me can only be you; my arms won't free you, my heart won't try.

MORE TODAY THAN YESTERDAY
I don't remember what day it was, I didn't notice what time it was
All I know is that I fell in love with you
And if all my dreams come true, I'll be spending time with you

Every day's a new day, in love with you. With each day comes a new way of loving you
Every time I kiss your lips, my mind starts to wander
And, if all my dreams come true, I'll be spending time with you
	Oh, I love you more today than yesterday, but not as much as tomorrow
	I love you more today than yesterday, but, darling, not as much as tomorrow
Tomorrow's date means springtime's just a day away
Cupid, I don't need you now, be on your way
I thank the Lord for love like ours that grows ever stronger
And I always will be true, I know you feel the same way too
	Oh, I love you more today than yesterday, but not as much as tomorrow
	I love you more today than yesterday, but, only half as much as tomorrow
Every day's a new day, every time I love ya, every way's a new way, every time I love ya
Every day's a new day, every time I kiss ya, every way's a new way, oh, how I love ya!

MOSCOW NIGHTS
Stillness in the grove, not a rustling sound, softly shines the moon, clear and bright
Dear, if you could know how I treasure so, this most beautiful Moscow night
Lazily the brook, like a silvery stream, ripples in the light of the moon
And a song afar fades, as in a dream, in this night that will end too soon (X2)

Dearest, why so sad, why the downcast eyes, and your lovely head bent so low
Oh, I mustn't speak, though I'd love to say that you've stolen my heart away
Promise me, my love, as the dawn appears, and the darkness turns into light
That you'll cherish, dear, through the passing years, this most beautiful Moscow night
Say you'll cherish, dear, through the passing years, this most beautiful Moscow night

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD
Hey, did you  happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world
And if you did, was she cryin', cryin'
Hey,  if you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her

I  woke up this morning, realized what I had done,
I  stood alone in the cold grey dawn, knew I'd lost my morning  sun
I  lost my head and I said some  things,
Now come the heartaches that the morning brings,
I  told her I'm wrong, that I couldn't see,  I let my world slip away from me.

So, hey, did you  happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world
And if you  did, was she cryin', cryin'
Hey,  if you  happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her  I'm  sorry, tell her I  need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her,

If you  happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Oh,  won't you tell her that I love her,

M-O-T-H-E-R
"M" is for the million things she gave me
"O" means only that she's growing old
"T" is for the tears she shed to save me
"H" is for her heart of purest gold
"E" is for her eyes with love-light shining
"R" means right and right she'll always be

Put them all together, they spell "MOTHER"
A word that means the world to me

MOTHER NATURE'S SON
Born a poor young country boy, Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone

Sit beside a mountain stream, see her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies
	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo  doo doo doo doo doo
Find me in my field of grass, Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun
	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo  doo doo doo doo doo

MOVIN' OUT (ANTHONY'S SONG)
Anthony works in the grocery store, saving his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door, she said, "Sonny, move out to the country."
Working too hard can give you a heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack! You oughta know by now.
Who needs a house out in Hackensack? Is that all you get for your money?
	And it seems such a waste of time, if that's what it's all about
	Mama, if that's movin' up, then  I'm movin' out.
Sergeant O'Leary is walking the beat, at night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mister Cacciatore's down on Sullivan street, across from the Medical Center
And he's trading in his Chevy for a Cadillac-ac-ac-ac-ac-ac! You oughta know by know
And, if he can't drive with a broken back, at least he can polish the fenders
	And it seems such a waste of time, if that's what it's all about
	Yeah, if that's movin' up, then  I'm movin' out.
You should never argue with a crazy mind-mind-mind-mind-mind-mind!
You oughta know by now.
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime, is that all you get for your money?
	And, if that's what you have in mind, yeah, if that's what you're all about
	Good luck movin' up, 'cause I'm movin' out.

MR. BLUE
	Our guardian star lost all his glow the day that I lost you
	He lost all his glitter the day you said no, and his silver turned to blue
	Like him, I am doubtful that your love is true
	But, if you decide to call on me, ask for Mr. Blue
I'm Mr. Blue, when you say you love me
Then prove it by going out on the sly, proving your love isn't true, call me Mr. Blue

I'm Mr. Blue, when you say you're sorry
Then turn around, headin' for the lights of town, hurtin' me through and through, call me Mr. Blue
      I stay at home at night, right by the phone at night
     But, you won't call, and I won't hurt my pride, call me Mr....
I won't tell you, while you paint the town
A bright red to turn it upside down, I'm painting it too, but I'm painting it blue
Call me Mr. Blue, call me Mr. Blue, call me Mr. Blue

MR. BOJANGLES
I knew a man Bo-jangles and he danced for you, in worn out shoes.
Silver hair, a ragged shirt, and baggy pants, the old soft shoe
He jumped so high, jumped so high, then he lightly touched down.
	      Mister Bo-jangles, Mister Bo-jangles, Mister Bo-jangles, dance.
I met him in a cell in New Or-leans, I was down and out.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
He talked of life, talked of life, he laughed, and slapped his leg a step.

He said his name, Bo-jangles, and he danced a lick, across the cell.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh,  he jumped so high, he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
	      Mister Bo-jangles, Mister Bo-jangles, Mister Bo-jangles, dance.
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the south.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years how his dog and him, they traveled about.
His dog up and died, up and died, after twenty years he still grieves,

He said, "I dance now at every chance in honky tonks for drinks and tips.
But most of the I spend behind these county bars, 'cause I drinks a bit."
He shook his head, and as he shook his head, I heard someone ask him please,
	      Mister Bo-jangles, Mister Bo-jangles, Mister Bo-jangles, dance.
	      Mister Bo-jangles, Mister Bo-jangles, Mister Bo-jangles, dance.

MRS. BROWN, YOU'VE GOT A LOVELY DAUGHTER
Mrs. Brown, you've got a lovely daughter. Girls as sharp as her are something rare
But it's sad, she doesn't love me now, she's made it clear enough, it ain't no good to pine

She wants to return those things I bought her. Tell her she can keep them just the same
Things have changed, she doesn't love me now, she's made it clear enough, it ain't no good to pine
     Walkin' about, even in a crowd, well, you'll pick her out. Makes a bloke feel so proud!
If she finds that I've been 'round to see you , tell her that I'm well and feelin' fine
Don't let on, don't say she's broke my heart, I'd go down on my knees but it's no good to pine
     Walkin' about, even in a crowd, well, you'll pick her out. Makes a bloke feel so proud!
If she finds that I've been 'round to see you , tell her that I'm well and feelin' fine
Don't let on, don't say she's broke my heart, I'd go down on my knees but it's no good to pine
	Mrs. Brown, you've got a lovely daughter (lovely daughter) (repeat and fade)

MUSIC, MUSIC, MUSIC
Put another nickel in, in the nickelodeon. All I want is having you and Music, Music, Music.
I'll do anything for you, anything you want me to. All I want is kissing you and Music, Music, Music.
	Closer, my dear, come closer, the nicest part of any melody is when you're dancing close to me.
So, put another nickel in, in the nickelodeon. All I want is loving you and Music, Music, Music.

MUSIC TO WATCH GIRLS BY
The boys watch the girls while the girls watch the boys who watch the girls go by
Eye to eye, they solemnly convene to make the scene
Which is the name of the game, watch a guy watch a dame on any street in town
Up and down and over and across, romance is boss
	Guys talk "girl talk", it happens everywhere
	Eyes watch girls walk with tender lovin' care
It's keepin' track of the pack watching them watching back
That makes the world go 'round
"What's that sound?" each time you hear a loud collective sigh
They're making music to watch girls by

MUSKRAT LOVE
Muskrat, muskrat, candlelight, doin' the town, and doin' it right
In the evenin', it's pretty pleasin'
Muskrat Susie, Muskrat Sam, do the jitterbug out in muskrat land
And they shimmy, and Sam is so skinny
	And they whirled, and they twirled, and they tangoed
	Singin' and jingin' the jango
	Floatin' like the heavens above, it looks like muskrat love
Nibblin' on bacon, chewin' on cheese, Sammy says to Susie, "Honey, would you please
Be my missus?" And she says yes with her kisses

And now he's ticklin' her fancy, rubbin her toes, muzzle to muzzle, now anything goes
As they wriggle, and Sue starts to giggle
	And they whirled, and they twirled, and they tangoed
	Singin' and jingin' the jango
	Floatin' like the heavens above, it looks like muskrat love

MY BABY JUST CARES FOR ME
My baby don't care for shows, my baby don't care for clothes, my baby just cares for me
My baby don't care for furs and laces, my baby don't care for high toned places.
My baby don't care for rings, or other expensive things, she's sensible as can be.
My baby don't care who knows it, my baby just cares for me.

My baby's no Gilbert fan, Ron Colman is not her man, my baby just cares for me
My baby don't care for Lawrence Tibbets,  she'd rather have me around to kibbitz.
Bud Rodgers iis noto her style, and even Chevalier's smile, is something that she can't see.
I wonder what's wrong with baby? My baby just cares for me.

MY BLUE HEAVEN
When Whippoorwills call and evening is nigh, I hurry to my blue heaven.
A turn to the right, a little white light will lead you to my blue heaven.
You'll see a smiling face, a fireplace, a cozy room, a little nest that's nestled where the roses bloom.
Just Mollie and me and baby makes three. We're happy in my blue heaven.

MY BONNIE LIES OVER THE OCEAN
My Bonnie lies over the ocean, my Bonnie lies over the sea.
My Bonnie lies over the ocean.  Oh, bring back my Bonnie  to  me.
Bring back, bring back, oh, bring back my Bonnie to me, to me.
Bring back, bring back, oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.

MY BUDDY
Life is a book that we study, some of its leaves bring a sigh,
There it was written, my buddy, that we must part, you and I.

Nights are long since you went away, I think about you all through the day,
	My buddy, my buddy, no buddy quite so true.
Miss your voice, the touch of your hand, just long to know that you understand,
	My buddy, my buddy, your buddy misses you
Buddies through all the gay days, buddies when something went wrong;
I wait alone through the gray days, missing your smile and your song.

MY FATHER
My father always promised  us that we would live in France
We'd go boating on the Seine, and I would learn to dance
We lived in Ohio then, he worked in the mines
On his dreams like boats we knew we would sail in time
	All my sisters soon were gone to Denver and Cheyenne
	Marrying their grownup dreams, the lilacs and the man
	I stayed behind the youngest still, only danced alone
	The colors of my father's dreams faded without a sound
And I live in Paris now, my children dance and dream
Hearing the ways of a miner's life, in words they've never seen
I sail my memories of home, like boats across the Seine
And watch the Paris sun, set in my father's eyes again
	My father always promised  us that we would live in France
	We'd go boating on the Seine, and I would learn to dance
	I sail my memories of home, like boats across the Seine
	And watch the Paris sun, set in my father's eyes again

MY FAVORITE THINGS
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, bright copper kettles and warm, woolen mittens,
Brown paper packages tied up with strings, these are a few of my favorite things.
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels, doorbells and sleighbells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings, these are a few of my favorite things
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes, snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes,
Silver-white winters that melt into springs, these are a few of my favorite things
When the dog bites, when the bee stings, when I'm feeling sad,
I simply remember my favorite things,  And then I don't feel.....so   bad.

MY FOOLISH HEART
The night is like a lovely tune, beware my foolish heart!
How white the ever constant moon; take care my foolish heart!
	There's a line between love and fascination that's hard to see on an evening such as this,
	For they both give the very same sensation when you're lost in the magic of a kiss
His lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart,
But should our eager lips combine then let the fire start
	For this time it isn't fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart
	It's love this time, it's love my foolish heart.
	It's love this time, it's love my foolish heart.

MY FUNNY VALENTINE
My funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine, you make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable, yet you're my favorite work of art.
Is your figure less than Greek, is your mouth a little weak,
When you open it to speak, are you smart?
But don't change a hair for me, not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay!  Each day is Valentine's day.

MY GIRL
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day. When it's cold outside, I've got the month of May.
	I guess you'd say, "What can make me feel this way?"
	My girl (my girl, my girl), talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl).
I've got so much honey, the bees envy me. I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees.
	Well, I guess you'd say, "What can make me feel this way?"
	My girl (my girl, my girl), talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl). Ooooh.
                 Hey hey hey, hey hey hey   Oooooo yeh!
I don't need no money, fortune or fame. I've got all the riches, baby, one man can claim.
	Well, I guess you'd say, "What can make me feel this way?"
	My girl (my girl, my girl), talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl).
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl, I've even got the month of May with my girl

MY GIRLFRIEND'S BACK
     She/he went away, and you hung around, and bothered me every night
     And when I wouldn't go out with you, you said things that weren't very nice
My girlfriend's/bf's back and you're gonna be in trouble (hey-la, hey-la, my gf's/bf's back)
When you see her/him comin', better cut out on the double (hey-la, hey-la, my gf's/bf's back)

You been spreading lies that I was untrue (hey-la, hey-la, my gf's/bf's back)
So look out now 'cause she's/he's comin' after you (hey-la, hey-la, my gf's/bf's back)
　　　　(Hey, she/he knows what you been tryin, and she/he knows that you been lyin')
She's/He's been gone for such a long time  (hey-la, hey-la, my gf's/bf's back)
Now she's/he's back and things'll be fine (hey-la, hey-la, my gf's/bf's back)

You're gonna be sorry you were ever born (hey-la, hey-la, my gf's/bf's back)
'Cause she's/he's kinda big and she's/he's awful strong (hey-la, hey-la, my gf's/bf's back)
	(Hey, she/he knows I wasn't cheatin', now you're gonna get a beatin')
     What made you think she'd/he'd believe all your lies? (Aah-ooh, aah-ooh)
     You're a big girl/man now but she'll/he'll cut you down to size (Aah-ooh, wait and see)
My girlfriend's/bf's back, she's/he's gonna save my reputation (hey-la, hey-la, my gf's/bf's back)
If I were you, I'd take a permanent vacation (hey-la, hey-la, my gf's/bf's back)
	(La, hey-la, my girlfriend's/bf's back, la, hey-la, my girlfriend's/bf's back )  (repeat, fade)

MY GUY
Nothing you could say could tear me away from my guy, (My guy)
Nothing you could do 'cause I'm stuck like glue to my guy. (My guy)
I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter,
Like birds of a feather we stick together,
I'm tellin' you from the start I can't be torn apart from my guy.

Nothing you could do could make me untrue to my guy, (My guy)
Nothing you could buy could make me tell a lie to my guy. (My guy)
I gave my guy my word of honor to be faithful, and I'm gonna,
You best be believing I won't be deceiving my guy.

As a matter of opinion I think he's tops, my opinion is he's the cream of the crop;
As a matter of taste to be exact he's my ideal as a matter of fact.

No muscle-bound man could take my hand from my guy. (My guy)
No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy. (My guy)
He may not be a movie star, but when it comes to bein' happy we are.
There's not a man today who could take me away from my guy.

MY KIND OF GIRL
She walks like an angel walks, she talks like an angel talks,
And her hair has a kind of curl, to my mind, she's my kind of girl.
She's wise like an angel's wise, with eyes like an angel's eyes,
And a smile like a kind of pearl, to my mind, she's my kind of girl.
	Pretty little face, that face just knocks me off my feet,
	Pretty little feet, she's really sweet enough to eat.
She looks like an angel looks, she cooks like an angel cooks,
And my mind's in a kind of whirl, to my mind, she's my kind of girl.
And my heart's kinda full of joy, because she's told me I'm her kind of boy.

MY LIFE
Got a call from an old friend, we used to be real close.  Said he couldn't go on, the American way
Closed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the West Coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.

I don't need you to worry for me, 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, and leave me alone
     I never said you had to offer me a second chance, I never said I was a victim of circumstance
     I still belong, don't get me wrong, and you can speak your mind, but not on my time
They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
Then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else
But sooner or later you sleep in your own space, either way it's okay to wake up with yourself

MY LOVE
	My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine, softer than a sigh
	My love is deeper than the deepest ocean, wider than the sky
	My love is brighter than the brightest star that shines every night above
	And there is nothing in this world that can ever change my love
Something happened to my heart the day that I met you, something that I never felt before
You are always on my mind, no matter what I do, and everyday it seems I want you more
	CHORUS
Once I thought that love was meant for anyone else but me, once I thought you'd never come my way
Now it only goes to show how wwrong we all can be, for now I have to tell you every day
	CHORUS  X2

MY MARIA
My Maria, don't you know I've come a long, long way
I been longin' to see her, when she's around she takes my blues away
Sweet Maria, the sunlight surely hurts my eyes
I'm a lonely dreamer, on a highway in the skies
	Maria, (Oh, Maria, I love you girl, oh, my Maria)
	Maria, (Oh, Maria, I love you, Maria) I love you
My Maria, there were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back my piece of mind
Gypsy lady, you're a miracle work for me
You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea
     She is the sunlight when skies are gray
     She treats me so right, lady, take me away
	Maria, (Oh, Maria, I love you girl, oh, my Maria)
	Maria, (Oh, Maria, I love you, Maria) I love you
	Maria, (Oh, Maria, I love you girl, oh, my Maria)
	Maria, (Oh, Maria, I love you, Maria) I love you

MY MELANCHOLY BABY
Come to me my melancholy baby, cuddle up and don't be blue . . .
All your fears are foolish fancy, maybe. You know dear that I'm in love with you!
Every cloud must have a silver lining, wait until the sun shines through
Smile my honey dear, while I kiss away each tear, or else I shall be melancholy too!

MY NEXT BROKEN HEART
You picked me up, you shot me down, you're steppin' out all over town
Drove me back to drinkin' in this bar
I found myself a brand new friend, I'm headed down that road again
I'm workin' on my next broken heart

Happy or sad, it's hard to tell, you taught me how to hurt so well
But when it comes to love, I know my part
Well, I'll play this game that I can't win, I'll be somebody's fool again
I'm workin' on my next broken heart
	Well, I thought all along you'd be the death of me
	But I met one tonight who wants what's left of me
I've seen that look before, she'll tear my world apart
I'm workin' on my next broken heart
	I thought all along you'd be the death of me
	I met one tonight who wants what's left of me
I've seen that look before, she'll tear my world apart
I'm workin' on my next broken heart, I'm workin' on my next broken heart
Oh, I'm working on my next broken heart.

MY ONE AND ONLY LOVE
The very thought of you makes my heart sing, like an April breeze on the wings of spring
And you appear in all your splendor, my one and only love

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms
I feel your lips so warm and tender, my one and only love
	The touch of your hand is like heaven, a heaven that I've never known
	The blush on your cheek whenever I speak, tells me that you are my own
You fill my eager heart with such desire, every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender, my one and only love

MY OLD FLAME
     The music seemed to be so reminiscent, I knew I heard it somewhere before
     I wracked my recollections as I listened, when suddenly I remembered once more
My old flame, I can't even think of her name
But it's funny now and then how my thoughts go flashing back again to my old flame

My old flame, my new lovers all seem so tame
For I haven't met a gal so magnificent, my only pal, as my old flame
	I've met so many who have fascinating ways, a fascinating gaze in their eyes
	Some who took me up to the skies, but their attempts at love were only imitations of
My old flame, I can't even think of her name
But I'll never be the same, until I discover what became of my old flame
No, I'll never be the same, until I discover what became of my old flame

MY PRAYER
When the twilight is gone and no songbirds are singing
When the twilight is gone you come into my heart
And here in my heart you will stay while I pray

My prayer is to linger with you
At the end of the day in a dream that's divine
My prayer is a rapture in blue
With the world far away and your lips close to mine
	Tonight while our hearts are aglow
	Oh tell me the words that I'm longing to know
My prayer and the answer you give
May they still be the same for as long as we live
That you'll always be there at the end of my prayer

MY RAMBLIN' BOY
He was a man and a friend always. He stuck with me in the hard old days.
He never cared if I had no dough, we rambled around in the rain and snow.
	And here's to you my Ramblin' Boy, may all your ramblin' bring you joy.
	Here's to you my Ramblin' Boy, may all your ramblin' bring you joy.
In Tulsa town we chanced to stray, we thought we'd try to work one day.
The boss said he had room for one. Said my old pal, we'd rather bum.
	And here's to you...
Late one night in a jungle camp, the weather it was cold and damp.
He got the chills and he got 'em bad. They took the only friend I had.
He left me here to ramble on. My ramblin' pal is dead and gone.
If when we die we go somewhere, I'll bet you a dollar he's ramblin' there.
	And here's to you...

MY ROMANCE
My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May, no twinkling stars. No hideaway, no soft guitars
My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain.
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance doesn't need a thing but you.

MY SHIP
My ship has sails that are made of silk, the decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice, there's a paradise in the hold
My ship's aglowe with a million pearls, and rubies fill each bin
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in
	I can wait the years 'til it appears one fine day, one spring
	But the pearls and such, they won't mean much, if there's missing just one thing
I do not care if that day arrives, that dream need never be
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me

MY SPECIAL ANGEL
	Angel, angel, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa  X2
You are my special angel, sent from up above
The Lord smiled down on me and sent an angel to love
You are my special angel, right from paradise
I know you're an angel, heaven is in your eyes
	The smile from your lips brings the summer sunshine, tears from your eyes bring the rain
	I feel your touch, your warm embrace, and I'm in heaven again
You are my special angel, through eternity
I'll have my special angel here to watch over me, here to watch over me.
	Angel, angel, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa

MY SUGAR IS SO REFINED
My sugar is so refined, she's one of them high-class kind
She doesn't wear a hat, she wears a chapeau
She goes to see a cinema, but never a show
     My sugar is so refined,  she's got a real high-class mind
She never buys a dress, it's always a frock
She always winds her timepiece up, but never her clock
	She says "tomahto"  instead of "tomato," she says"potahto" instead of "potato"
	And you should see how she holds a cup of tea
	With just two fingers while she sticks out three.
     My sugar is so refined, she's one of them high-class kind
She never shares a kiss, she lets our lips unite
But, oh, it feels like kissin' and each kiss is dyna-mite
I wonder what she thinks of each time I hold her tight, ooh, she's so re-fined
   My sugar is real refined, got the finest kind of mind
She never eats a meal, she "dines" or "sups"
And of the little canine friends, they're never "pups"
	She says "banahna," instead of "banana," she says "piahno," instead of "pianna"
	And you should see how she sits on her settee
	With cake and coffee balanced on one knee
     My sugar is so refined,  she's one of them high-class kind
She acts just like her name is Mrs. Vanderloo,
And though I love her, and we'll be married too
I wonder what she'll do when we're on our honeymoon,
Ooh, she's so refined, she's so refined, yeah, she's so refined

MY SWEET LADY
Lady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me?
Did you think our time together was all gone?
Lady, you've been dreaming. I'm as close as I can be.
And I swear to you our time has just begun.
	Close your eyes and rest your weary mind. I promise I will stay right here beside you.
	Today our lives were joined, became entwined.
	I wish that you could know how much I love you.
Lady, are you happy, do you feel the way I do?
Are there meanings that you've never seen before?
Lady, my sweet lady, I just can't believe it's true.
And it's like I've never ever loved before.
	Close your eyes and rest your weary mind. I promise I will stay right here beside you.
	Today our lives were joined, became entwined.
	I wish that you could know how much I love you.
Lady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me?
Did you think our time together was all gone?
Lady, you've been dreaming. I'm as close as I can be.
And I swear to you our time has just begun.

MY WALKING STICK
Without my walking stick, I'd go insane.
Can't look my best, I feel undressed without my cane

Must have my walking stick 'cause it may rain
When it pours, can't be outdoors without my cane
	If I ever left my house without my walking stick
	Well, it would be something I could never explain
Oh, the thing that makes me click on lover's lane
Would go for naught if I were caught without my cane
	If I ever left my house without my walking stick
	Well, it would be something I could never explain
Oh, the thing that makes me click on lovers lane
Would go for naught if I were caught without my cane

MY WAY
And now, the end is near, and so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear, I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full, I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few, but, then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do, and saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way
	Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew, when I bit off more than I could chew
　　　　But, through it all, when there was doubt, I ate it up, and spit it out
　　　　I faced it all, and I stood tall, and did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed and cried, I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing
To think, I did all that, and may I say, not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me, I did it my way
	For, what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels, and not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows, and did it my way.......Yes, it was my way

WHEN IRISH EYES ARE SMILING
When Irish  eyes are smiling, sure it's like a morn in Spring
In the lilt of Irish laughter you can hear the angels sing
When Irish hearts are happy, all the world seems bright and gay
And when Irish  eyes are smiling, sure they steal your heart a-way.

MY WILD IRISH ROSE
My wild Irish  rose, the sweetest flower that grows,
You may search everywhere, but none can compare with my wild Irish rose.
My wild Irish rose, the dearest flower that grows,
And, someday for my sake, she may let me take the bloom from my wild Irish rose.

MY WORLD IS EMPTY WITHOUT YOU
My world is empty without you, babe, my world is empty without you, babe.
	And as I go my way alone, I find it hard for me to carry on.
	I need your strength, I need your tender touch, I need the love, my dear, I miss so much.
My world is empty without you, babe, my world is empty without you, babe.
	From this old world, I try to hide my face,  but from this loneliness, there's no hiding place.
	Inside this cold and empty house, I dwell, in darkness, with memories I know so well.
My world is empty without you, babe, my world is empty without you, babe.
	I need love now, much more than before,  I can hardly carry on anymore.
My world is empty without you, babe, without you, babe, without you, babe.
	My mind and soul, have felt like this, since love between us no more exists.
           	And each time that darkness falls, it finds me alone, with these four walls.
My world is empty without you, babe, without you, babe, without you, babe.
My world is empty without you, babe, without you!

NATURE BOY
There was a boy, a very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far, over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye, but very wise was he.
And then one day, one magic day he came my way.
And as we spoke of many things, fools and kings, this he said to me:
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return."

THE NAUGHTY LADY OF SHADY LANE
The naughty lady of Shady Lane has hit the town like a bomb,
The back fence gossips ain't been this good since Mabel ran off with Tom.
Our town was peaceful and quiet before she came on the scene,
The lady has started a riot disturbing the suburban routine.
Oh the naughty lady of Shady Lane has the town in a whirl,
The naughty lady of Shady Lane.......me oh my oh what a girl.
        (Bum ba da bum bum bum bum, bum ba da bum bum bum)
You should see how she carries on with her admirers galore,
She must be giving them quite a thrill the way they flock to her door.
She throws those come-hither glances at every Tom, Dick and Joe,
When offered some liquid refreshment, the lady never never says no.
Oh the naughty lady of Shady Lane has the town in a whirl,
The naughty lady of Shady Lane.......me oh my oh what a girl.
        (Bum ba da bum bum bum bum, bum ba da bum bum bum)
        (Bum ba da bum bum bum bum, bum ba da bum bum bum)
The things they're trying to pin on her won't hold much water I'm sure,
Beneath the powder and fancy lace there beats a heart sweet and pure.
She just needs someone to change her, then she'll be nice as can be,
If you're in the neighborhood, stranger, you're welcome to drop in and see!
The naughty lady of shady  lane so delightful to hold,
The naughty lady of Shady Lane......so delectable, quite respectable
And she's only  nine days old.

THE NEARNESS OF YOU
It's not the pale moon that excites me, that thrills and delights me
Oh no, it's just the nearness of you.
It isn't your sweet conversa - tion that brings this sensation
Oh no, it's just the nearness of you.
When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true.
I need no soft lights to enchant me if you'll only grant me
The right to hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night the nearness of you.

NEVER BEEN TO SPAIN
Well, I've never been to Spain, but I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there, and they sure know how to use it
	They don't abuse it, never gonna lose it, I can't refuse it
Well, I've never been to England, but I kinda like the Beatles
Well, I headed to Las Vegas, only made it out to Needles
	Can you feel it? Must be near it, feels so good, oh, it feels so good
Well, I've never been to heaven, but I've been to Oklahoma
Oh, they tell me I was born there, but I really don't remember
	In Oklahoma, not Arizona, what does it matter? What does it matter?
Well, I've never been to Spain, but I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there, and they sure know how to use it
	They don't abuse it, never gonna lose it, I can't refuse it
Well, I've never been to heaven, but I've been to Oklahoma
Oh, they tell me I was born there, but I really don't remember
	In Oklahoma, not Arizona, what does it matter? What does it matter?

NEVER CAN SAY GOODBYE
	Never can say goodbye, no, I never can say goodbye.
Even though the pain and heartache, seem to follow wherever I go.
Though I try and try to hide my feelings, they always seem to show.
Then you try to say you're leaving me, and I always have to say no...
Tell me why, is it  so? That I...
	Never can say goodbye, no, I never can say goodbye.
Every time I think I've had enough, and start heading for the door.
There's a very strange vibration, pierces me right to the core.
It says turn around you fool, you know you love her more and more.
Tell me why, is it so? Don't wanna let you go!
	    I never can say goodbye girl,
	    I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, no no no
	    I never can say goodbye girl,
	    I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, no no no
            Never can say goodbye, no, I never can say goodbye.
I keep thinkin' that our problems soon, are all gonna work out.
But there's that same unhappy feeling, and there's that anguish there's that doubt.
It's that same old dizzy hang up, can't live with you, or without.
Tell me why, is it so? Don't wanna let you go!
	    I never can say goodbye girl,
	    I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, no no no
	    I never can say goodbye girl, I never can say goodbye

NEVER MY LOVE
You ask me if there'll come a time when I grow tired of you.
Never, my love, never, my love
You wonder if htis heart of mine will lose its desire for you
Never, my love, never, my love
What makes you think love will end, when you know that my whole life depends on you, on you

How can you think love will end, when I've asked you to spend your whole life with me, with me
You say you fear I'll change my mind, I won't require you.
Never, my love, never, my love..... Never, my love, never, my love

NEVER NEVER LAND
I know a place where dreams are born, and time is never planned
It's not on any chart, you must find it with your heart-Never Never Land
It might be miles beyond the moon, or right there where you stand
Just have an open mind, and then suddenly you'll find Never Never Land
	You'll have a treasure if you stay there, more precious far than gold
	For, once you have found your way there, you can never, never grow old
So come with me where dreams are born, and time is never planned
Just think of lovely things, and your heart will fly on wings, forever in Never Never Land

NEVER SWAT A FLY
Never swat a fly, he may love another fly
He may sit with her and sigh the way I do with you
Never harm a flea, he may have a favorite she
That he bounces on his knee the way I do with you
Never stop a moth when he is gliding through the air
He may have a date in someone's flannel underware...ah be careful
Never spray a nit with a great big can of blitz
He may think some nit has it the way I do with you

NEVERTHELESS
Maybe I'm right and maybe I'm wrong, and maybe I'm weak and maybe I'm strong.
But, nevertheless, I'm in love with you.

Maybe I'll win and maybe I'll lose, and maybe I'm in for crying the blues.
But, nevertheless, I'm in love with you.
	Somehow I know at a glance the terrible chances I'm taking
	Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking.
Maybe I'll live a life of regret, and maybe I'll give much more than I'll get,
But, nevertheless, I'm in love with you.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK
Start spreadin' the news, I'm leavin' today, I want to be a part of it-New York, New York
These vagabond shoes are longing to stray, and right through the very heart of it-N.Y., N.Y.
	I want to wake up in the city that doesn't sleep
	And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap
These little town blues are melting away, I'll make a brand new start of it-in old New York
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere, it's up to you, New York, New York
	New York, New York. I want to wake up in the city that never sleeps
	And find I'm "A" number one, top of the list, king of the hill

NEW YORK'S NOT MY HOME
Well, things were spinning round me, and all my thoughts were cloudy
And, I had begun to doubt all the things that were me
Been in so many places, you know I've run so many races
And looked into the empty faces of the people of the night, and something is just not right
	'Cause I know that I gotta get out of here, I'm so alone
	Don't you know that I gotta get out of here, 'cause New York's not my home
Though all the streets are crowded, there's something strange about it
I lived there 'bout a year and I never once felt at home
I thought I'd make the big time, I learned a lot of lessons awful quick, and now I'm
Tellin' you that they were not the nice kind, and it's been so long since I have felt fine
	And that's the reason that I gotta get out of here, I'm so alone
	Don't you know that I gotta get out of here, 'cause New York's not my home

	And that's the reason that I gotta get out of here, I'm so alone
	Don't you know that I gotta get out of here, 'cause New York's not my home

NICE AND EASY
Let's take it nice and easy, it's gonna be so easy, for us to fall in love
Hey, baby, what's your hurry? Relax, and don't you worry, we're gonna fall in love
	We're on the road to romance. That's safe to say,
	But let's make all the stops along the way
The problem now of course is to simply hold your horses, to rush would be a crime
'Cause nice and easy does it every time

NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT
The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight 'neath a starry sky.
Nice work if you can get it, and you can get it if you try.
Strolling with the one girl, sighing sigh after sigh.
Nice work if you can  get it, and you can get it if you try.
Just imagine someone wating at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one, who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you, and then taking that vow,
Nice work if you can get it, and if you get it, won't you tell me how?

NIGHT AND DAY
Night and day, you are the one.  Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near to me or far, it's no matter, darling, where you are I think of you   night and day.
Day and night, why is it so, that this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom, in the silence of my lonely room I think of you  night and day
Night and day under the hide of me, there's an oh, such a hungry yearning, burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through 'til you let me spend my life making love to you, night and day

THE NIGHT BEFORE
We said our good-byes (Ah the night before). Love was in your eyes (Ah the night before)
    Now today I find  you have changed your mind. Treat me like you did the night be-fore
Were you telling lies (Ah the night before). Was I so un-wise (Ah the night before)
   When I held you near you were so sincere. Treat me like you did the night before
	Last night is the night I will remember you by
	When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry
We said our good-byes (Ah the night before). Love was in your eyes (Ah the night before)
Now today I find  you have changed your mind. Treat me like you did the night be-fore
   When I held you near you were so sin-cere.Treat me like you did the night be-fore
	Last night is the night I will remember you by
	When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry
Were you telling lies (Ah the night before). Was I so un-wise (Ah the night before)
   When I held you near you were so sincere. Treat me like you did the night before

THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES
They say that you're a runaround lover, though you say it isn't so
But, if you put me down for another,  I'll know, believe me, I'll know
'Cause the night has a thousand eyes, and a thousand eyes can't help but see if you are true to me
So, remember when you tell those little white  lies that the night has a thousand eyes
You say that you're at home when you phone me, and how much you really care
Though you keep telling me that you're lonely, I'll know if someone is there=
'Cause the night has a thousand eyes, and a thousand eyes can't help but see if you are true to me
One of these  days you're gonna be sorry 'cause your game I'm gonna play
And you'll find out without really tryin' each time that my kisses stray
'Cause the night has a thousand eyes, and a thousand eyes will see me too, and no matter what I do
I could never disguise all my little white lies 'cause the night has a thousand eyes
So, remember when you tell those little white  lies that the night has a thousand eyes

A NIGHTINGALE SANG IN BERKELEY SQUARE
That certain night, the night we met, there was magic in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz, and a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
I may be right, I may be wrong, but I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me, a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
	The moon that lingered over London Town, poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown
	How could he know we two were so in love? The whole darn world seemed upside-down
The streets of town were paved with stars, it was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed, and said good-night, a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

THE NIGHT THEY DROVE OLD DIXIE DOWN
Virgil Caine is my name, and I served on the Danville train
'Til Stoneman's cavalry came, and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
By May the tenth, Richmond had fell, it's a time I remember, oh, so well
	The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringin'
	The night they drove old Dixie down, and the people were singin'
	They went, "Na, la, la, la, la, na, la, la, la, na, la, la, la, la, la"
Back with my wife in Tennessee, when one day she called to me,
"Virgil, quick! Come see! There goes the Robert E. Lee."
Now I don't mind chopping wood, and I don't care if the money's no good
You take what you need and you leave the rest, but they should never have taken the very best
	The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringin'
	The night they drove old Dixie down, and the people were singin'
	They went, "Na, la, la, la, la, na, la, la, la, na, la, la, la, la, la"
Like my father before me, I will work the land
And like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave ,but a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet, you can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat
	The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringin'
	The night they drove old Dixie down, and all the people were singin'
	They went, "Na, la, la, la, la, na, la, la, la, na, la, la, la, la, la"
9  TO  5
Tumble outta bed, and I stumble to the kitchen, pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch, and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin', out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5
      Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin', barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
      They just use your mind, and they never give you credit
      It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
	9 to 5, for service and devotion, you would think that I would deserve a fat promotion
	Want to move ahead, but the boss won't seem to let me
	I swear sometimes that man is out to get me!
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter, you're just a step on the boss-man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends, waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
An' the tide's gonna turn, and it's all gonna roll your way
    Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin', barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
    They just use your mind, and you never get the credit
    It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
         9 to 5, they got you where they want you
        There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
        It's a rich man's game, no matter what they call it
        And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5, whoa, what a way to make a livin', barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind, and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
      9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
      There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
      It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
      And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet

NO ARMS CAN EVER HOLD YOU
No arms can ever hold you like these arms of mine
No heart can ever love you like this heart of mine
     My dreams can all come true if you'll care for me
     This love that I feel for you was just meant to be
No lips can ever kiss you like these lips of mine
No one can ever offer what I offer you
	My heart, my love, are yours 'til the end of time
	No arms can ever hold you like these arms of mine
No lips can ever kiss you like these lips of mine
No one can ever offer what I offer you
	My heart, my love, are yours 'til the end of time
	No arms can ever hold you like these arms....of.....mine

NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE RAILROADS ANYMORE
When we got married, back in 1944, we'd board that silver liner below Baltimore
Trip to Virginia on a sunny honeymoon, nobody cares about the railroads anymore.
We'd tip that porter for a place of our own, then send a postcard to your Mom and Dad back home
Did somethin' to ya when you'd hear that "all aboard!" nobody cares about the railroads anymore
	Oo-ee, oo-ee, oo-ee..................oo-ee, oo-ee, oo-ee   HOOOOO
We had a daughter, and you ought to see her now. She has a boyfriend who looks just like my gal sal
And when they're married they won't need us anymore,
They'll board an aeroplane and fly away from Baltimore.
	Oo-ee, oo-ee, oo-ee...................oo-ee, oo-ee, oo-ee   HOOOOO  (Repeat 1st verse)

NOBODY CARES IF I'M BLUE
All the old gang I once knew now have left me two by two.
The old neighborhood don't look so good, I'm so lonely by my only.
Each and every one it seems meets the ideal of their dreams.
I've searched everywhere for my ideal. Now I'm beginning to feel

Nobody knows, nobody cares if I'm lonesome. Nobody sighs, nobody cries if I'm blue.
It seems that night after night, I sit alone and twiddle my thumbs.
But, still I keep right on hoping, keep the door open, but nobody comes.

Ain't it a crime, kisses of mine are just wasted? Since I'm so blue, I'm singin', "What'll I do?"
Like a play-thing on the shelf, I guess I'll have to play by myself.
'Cause nobody knows, nobody cares if I'm blue.

Ain't it a crime, kisses of mine are just wasted? Since I'm so blue, I'm singin', "What'll I do?"
Like a play-thing on the shelf, I guess I'll have to play by myself.
'Cause nobody knows, nobody cares  for me, my sorrow grows, 'cause nobody shares with me,
Nobody knows, nobody cares if I'm blue!

NOBODY KNOWS YOU WHEN YOU'RE DOWN AND OUT
Once I lived the life of a millionaire, spendin' all my money, and I didn't care
Takin' my friends out for a mighty good time, buying bootleg liquor, champagne and wine
Then I began to fall so low, didn't have a friend, and no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again, I'm gonna squeeze it till the eagle grins, because...
	Nobody knows you when you're down and out
	In your pocket, not one penny, as for your friends-you ain't got too many
	But as soon as you get back on your feet again, everybody wants to be your long lost friend
	It's mighty strange, without a doubt, nobody knows you when you're down and out

NOBODY'S SWEETHEART
You're nobody's sweetheart now, they don't baby you somehow
Fancy hose, silken gown, you'd be out of place in your own home town
When you walk down the avenue, I just can't believe that it's you
Painted lips, painted eyes, wearing a bird of paradise
It all seems so wrong somehow, that you're nobody's sweetheart now.

NO MATTER WHAT-(Boyzone)
No matter what they tell us, no matter what they do
No matter what they teach us, what we believe is true

No matter what they call us, however they attack
No matter where they take us, we'll find our own way back
	I can't deny what I believe,  I can't be what I'm not
	I know I'll love forever, I know no matter what
If only tears were laughter, if only night was day
If only prayers were answered, then we would hear God say

No matter what they tell us, no matter what they do
No matter what they teach us, what we believe is true
	And I will keep you safe and strong. and shelter from the storm
	No matter where it's barren, a dream is being born
No matter who they follow, no matter where they lead
No matter how they judge us, I'll be everyone you need
	No matter if the sun don't shine, or if the skies are blue
	No matter what the end is, my life began with you
	I can't deny what I believe,  I can't be what I'm not
	I know this love's forever, that's all that matters now, No Matter What
No, No Matter What, No Matter What, No Matter What

NO MOON AT ALL
No moon at all, what a night, even lightning bugs have dimmed their light
Stars have disappeared from sight, and there's no moon at all

Don't make a sound, it's so dark, even Fido is afraid to bark
What a perfect chance to park, and there's no moon at all
	If we want atmosphere for inspiration, dear
	One kiss will make it clear, that tonight is right, and bright moonlight might interfere
No moon at all up above, this is nothing like they told us of
Just to think we fell in love, and there's no moon at all
	If we want atmosphere for inspiration, dear
	One kiss will make it clear, that tonight is right, and bright moonlight might interfere
No moon at all up above, this is nothing like they told us of
Just to think we fell in love, and there's no moon at all
No moon at all, no moon at all, no moon at all!

NO MORE BLUES
No more blues I'm going back home
No, no more blues I promise no more to roam
Home is where the heart is
The funny part is, my heart's been right here all alone
No more tears, and no more sighs
No, no more fears- I'll say no more goodbye
If travel beckons me, I swear I'm gonna refuse
I'm gonna settle down, and there'll be no more blues
Everyday while I am far away
My thoughts turn homeward, forever homeward
I've traveled round the world in search of happiness
But all the happiness I've found is in my hometown
No more blues I'm going back home
No, no more blues I'm through with all my wandering now
I'll settle down and never roam
And find a man and build a home
When we settle down, there'll be no more blues
Nothing but happiness
When we settle down, there'll be no more blues

NO, NOT MUCH
I don't want my arms a-round you, no not much.
I   don't    bless    the   day I found you, no not much
	  I don't need   you   like the stars don't need the sky.
	  I won't love you longer           than the day  I   die
You don't please me  when you squeeze me, no not much
My head's the light-est from   your   very   slight-est touch
	Baby, if you ever go could I take it      maybe so. Ah, but would I like it, no not much
	Ah, but would I like it......... no...not....much.
I don't care  to    hug and kiss you,  no not much.
When you're gone I  never   miss   you, no not much
	Like  a   ten    cent   soda      does-n't       cost  a   dime
	I don't want you near me,        only      all the time
You don't  thrill  me  when  you  hold    me, no not much
My  brain gets   haz-y   from your cool and  craz--y  touch
	Baby, if you ever go could I take it      maybe so. Ah, but would I like it, no not much
	Ah, but would I like it......... no...not....much.

NO OTHER LOVE
No other love have I, only my love for you
Only the dream we knew, no other love
Watching the night go by, wishing that you could be
Watching the night with me, into the night I cry,
	"Hurry home, come home to me, set me free"
	Free from doubt, and free from longing
Into your arms I'll fly, locked in your arms I'll stay
Waiting to hear you say, "No other love have I." No other love!
	Into the night I cry, "Hurry home, come home to me, set me free"
	Free from doubt, and free from longing
Into your arms I'll fly, locked in your arms I'll stay
Waiting to hear you say, "No other love have I." No other love have I!

NO REPLY
This happened once before,  when I came to your door, no reply
They said it wasn't you, but I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light, I saw the light, I know that you saw me, 'cause I looked up to see  your face
I tried to telephone, they said you were not home, that's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been,  I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died, 'cause you walked hand in hand with another man in my place
	If I were you  I'd realize  that I love you more than any other guy
	And I'll for-give  the lies  that I heard be-fore  when you gave me no reply
I tried to tele-phone,  they said you were not home, that's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been,  I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died, 'cause you walked hand in hand with another man in my place
No reply, no reply

NORWEGIAN WOOD
I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me
She showed me her room, isn't it good, Norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
	I sat on the rug, biding my time, drinking her wine
	We talked until two and then she said, "It's time for bed"
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit the fire, isn't it good, Norwegian wood?

NOWHERE MAN
He's a real nowhere man, sitting in his nowhere land, making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view, knows not where he's going to, isn't he a bit like you and me?
	Nowhere man, please listen. You don't know what you're missin'
	Nowhere man, the world is at your command
	Nowhere man, don't worry. Take your time, don't hurry
	Leave it all, till somebody else lends you a hand
Doesn't have a point of view, knows not where he's going to, isn't he a bit like you and me?
	Nowhere man, please listen. You don't know what you're missin'
	Nowhere man, the world is at your command
He's a real nowhere man, sitting in his nowhere land, making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody. Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.

(I'M GETTIN') NUTTIN' FOR CHRISTMAS
Oh, I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas, Mommy and Daddy are mad.
I'm getting nuttin' for Christmas, 'cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad.
I broke my bat on Johnny's head; somebody snitched on me.
I hid a frog in sister's bed; somebody snitched on me.
I spilled some ink on Mommy's rug, I made Tommy eat a bug
Bought some gum with a penny slug; somebody snitched on me.
	Oh, I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas, Mommy and Daddy are mad.
	I'm getting nuttin' for Christmas, 'cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad.
I put a tack on teacher's chair; somebody snitched on me.
I tied a knot in Susie's hair; somebody snitched on me.
I did a dance on Mommy's plants, climbed a tree and tore my pants
Filled the sugar bowl with ants; somebody snitched on me.
	Oh, I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas, Mommy and Daddy are mad.
	I'm getting nuttin' for Christmas, 'cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad.
So you better be good whatever you do, 'cause if you're bad, I'm warning you,
You'll get nuttin' for Christmas.

OB-LA-DI, OB-LA-DA
Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace, Molly is a singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face," and Molly says this as she takes him by the hand,
　　　　Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, life goes on, brah, la, la, how their life goes on  (X2)
Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store, buys a twenty-carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly, waiting at the door, and as he gives it to her, she begins to sing,
　　　　Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, life goes on, brah, la, la, how their life goes on  (X2)
     In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
     With a couple of kids running in the yard of Desmond and Mollie Jones
Happy ever after in the marketplace, Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home, and does her pretty face, and in the evening she's still singin' with the band
　　　　Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, life goes on, brah, la, la, how their life goes on  (X2)
     In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home

OCTOPUS'S GARDEN
I'd like to be under the sea, in an octopus's garden, in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been, in his octopus's garden in the shade
	I'd ask my friends to come and see an octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea, in an octopus's garden, in the shade

We would be warm below the storm, in our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed, in an octopus's garden near a cave
	We would sing and dance around because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea, in an octopus's garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about the coral that lies beneath the waves
Oh, what joy for every girl and boy, knowing they're happy and they're safe
	We would be so happy, you and me. No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea, in an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you... in an octopus's garden with you

ODE DE TOILET
She says not to buy her flowers Or big expensive gifts
She says she don't want jewlery And she doesn't need another dress
If I want to show her how much I adore her The best way that I've found
Is to make sure when I'm finished, I put that toilet seat down.

We've been to counseling To try and see the ways we could improve
This thing between us And different ways to show each other "I love you"
Forget about those getaway vacations To romantic coastal towns
If you want to say "I love you" Then put that toilet seat down.

'Cause in the middle of the night It's cold and it's dark
And when I hear my name in vain I know I haven't done my part
She just wants me to support her And the best way that I've found
So with a gentle hand and a loving touch I put that toilet seat down.

I know it's kind of funny You can teach a little puppy
But it's very hard to train a grown man When I'm all about my buisiness
And the path of least resistance, she's the one that suffers in the end.

In the middle of the night It's cold and it's dark
And when I hear my name in vain I know I haven't done my part
She just wants me to support her And the best way that I've found
So with a gentle hand and a loving touch I put that toilet seat down
Down, down...

OH, BABY MINE (I GET SO LONELY)
Oh, baby mine, I get so lonely when I dream about you,
Can't do without you, that's why I dream about you
If I could only put my arms about you, life would be so fair

If you were here, we two could hug and kiss, and never tire
I'm on fire, you are my one desire
I get so lonely when I dream about you, why can't you be there?
	Tossin' and turnin' in my slumber, holdin' you it seems
	I give you kisses without number, but only in my dreams
Oh, baby mine, I get so lonely when I dream about you,
Can't do without you, that's why I dream about you
If I could only put my arms about you, life would be so fair

OH BOY!
All of my love, all of my kissin', you don't know what you've been missin', oh boy! (Oh boy!)
When you're with me, oh boy! (Oh boy!), the world can see that you were meant for me

All of my life, I've been waitin', tonight there'll be no hesitatin', oh boy! (Oh boy!)
When you're with me, oh boy! (Oh boy!), the world can see that you were meant for me
         Stars appear and the shadows are fallin', you can hear my heart a-callin'
         A little bit of lovin' makes everything right, I'm gonna see my baby tonight
All of my love, all of my kissin', you don't know what you've been missin', oh boy! (Oh boy!)
When you're with me, oh boy! (Oh boy!), the world can see that you were meant for me
	(Dum de dum dum, oh boy!)
	(Dum de dum dum, oh boy!)

OH CHANUKAH
Oh, Chanukah, oh Chanukah, come light the menorah. Let's have a party, we'll all dance the hora
Gather 'round the table, I'll give you a treat. Dray—dles to play with and latkes to eat.
And while we are playing, the candles are burning low,
One for each night, they shed a sweet light, to remind us of days long ago.
One for each night, they shed a sweet light, to remind us of days long ago.

OH, DONNA
Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna
I had a girl. Donna was her name. Since she left me, I've never been the same.
'Cause I love my girl. Donna, where can you be? Where can you be?
Now that you're gone, I'm left all alone, all by myself to wander and roam.
'Cause I love my girl. Donna, where can you be?
	Darling, now that you're gone, I don't know what I'll do.
	Oh, time, and all my love, for you.
Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna
I had a girl. Donna was her name. Since she left me, I've never been the same.
'Cause I love my girl. Donna, where can you be? Where can you be? Where can you be?
Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna

OH, GIRL
Oh, girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now.
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I Just don't know how.

Oh, girl, how I depend on you, to give me love when I need it.
Right on time you would always be.
	All my friends call me a fool. They say, "Let the woman take care of you."
	So I try to be hip, and think like the crowd.
	But even the crowd can't help me now, oh-oh-oh
Oh, girl, tell me what am I gonna do.
I know I've got a guilty face. Girl, I feel so out of place, oh yeah.
	Don't know where to go, who to see, yeah.
Oh, girl, I guess I better go.
I can save myself a lot of useless tears. Girl I've gotta get away from here.

Oh, girl, pain will double if you leave me now.
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, and I don't, I don't know how.

HAVE YOU SEEN HER
Oh, I see her face everywhere I go, on the street, and even at the picture show
Have you seen her, tell me, have you seen her?
Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow, in the sweet music on my radio
Have you seen her, tell me, have you seen her?
	        Why, oh, why did she have to leave and go a-way, oh, oh, oh, oh
	         I've been used to havin' someone to lean on, and I'm lost, baby, I'm lost
Oh, she left her kiss up-on my lips, but left that break within my heart
Have you seen her, tell me, have you seen her?
Oh, I see her hand reaching out to me, only she can set me free
Have you seen her, tell me, have you seen her?
	        Why, oh, why did she have to leave and go a-way, oh, oh, oh, oh
	         I've been used to havin' someone to lean on, and I'm lost, baby, I'm lost

OH, LONESOME ME
Everybody's goin' out and havin' fun. I'm just a fool for stayin' home and havin' none.
I can't get over how she set me free.  Oh, lonesome me.
A bad mistake I'm makin' by just hangin' 'round.
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool that's blind and just can't see,  oh, lonesome me
	I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free, flirting with the boys with all her charms
	But I still love her so and, brother, don't you know I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues,
Forget about the past and find somebody new.
I've thought of everything from A to Z.  Oh, lonesome me, oh, lonesome me, oh, lonesome me.

OH! MY PAPA
Oh! My Papa, to me he was so wonderful, OMP, to me he was  so good.
No one could be so gentle and so lovable. OMP, he always understood
Gone are the days when he would take me on his knee
And with a smile, he'd change my tears to laughter.
OMP, so funny, so adorable, always the clown, so funny in his way.
OMP, to me he was so wonderful, deep in my heart I miss him so today.
Oh! My Papa, Oh! My Papa.

OH PROMISE ME
Oh, promise me that some day you and I will take our love together to some sky
Where we can be alone, and faith renew, and find the hollows where those flowers grew
Those first sweet violets of early spring, which come in whispers, thrill us both and sing
Of love, unspeakable that is to be, oh, promise me, oh, promise me

OH WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MORNING
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow! There's a bright golden haze on the meadow!
The corn is as high as an elephant's eye, and it looks like it's climbin' clear up to the sky!
	Oh, what a beautiful morn-in'! Oh, what a beautiful day!
	I've got a beautiful feel-in',    everything's goin' my way!
All the cattle are standin' like statues. All the cattle are standin' like statues.
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by, but a little brown maverick is winkin' her eye!
 	CHORUS
All the sounds of the earth are like music! All the sounds of the earth are like music!
The breeze is so busy, it don't miss a tree, and an old weepin' willow is laughin' at me!
	CHORUS

OH! YOU BEAUTIFUL DOLL
Oh! You beautiful doll, you great big beautiful doll
Let me put my arms about you
I could never live without you
Oh! You beautiful doll, you great big beautiful doll
If you ever leave me, how my heart would ache
I want to hug you but I fear you'd break
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! You beautiful doll.

OKLAHOMA
	Gonna give you barley, carrots and potatoes,
	Pasture for the cattle, spinach and tomatoes!
	Flowers on the prairie where the June bugs zoom, plenty of air and plenty of room
	Plenty of room to swing a rope, plenty of heart and plenty of hope!
Oklahoma, where the wind comes sweepin' down the plain,
And the wavin' wheat can sure smell sweet, when the wind comes right behind the rain.
Oklahoma, every night my honey lamb and I
Sit alone and talk, and watch a hawk makin' lazy circles in the sky.
	We know we belong to the land, and the land we belong to is grand!
And when we say, yeeow-a-yip-i-o-ee ay!
We're only sayin' You're doin' fine, Oklahoma! Oklahoma, OKLAHOMA, Oklahoma!

OLD CAPE COD
If you're fond of sand dunes and salty air, quaint little villages here and there,
You're sure to fall in love with Old Cape Cod.
If you like the taste of a lobster stew, served by a window with an ocean view,
You're sure to fall in love with Old Cape Cod.
	Winding roads that seem to beckon you,
	Miles of green beneath the skies of blue,
	Church bells chiming on a Sunday morn
	Remind you of the town where you were born.
If you spend an evening, you'll want to stay, watching the moonlight on Cape Cod Bay;
You're sure to fall in love with Old Cape Cod.
You're sure to fall in love with Old Cape Cod.

THE OLD FOLKS
The old folks don't talk much, and they talk so slowly when they do
They are rich, they are poor, their illusions are gone, they share one heart for two

Their homes all smell of time, of old photographs and an old-fashioned song
Though you may live in town, you live so far away, when you've lived too long

And have they laughed too much, do their dry voices crack, talking of times gone by
And have they cried too much, a tear or two still always seems to cloud the eye

They tremble as they watch the old silver clock, when day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, "Yes," it says, "No," it says, "I'll wait for you"

The old folks dream no more, the books have gone to sleep, the piano's out of tune
The little cat is dead and no more do they sing on a Sunday afternoon

The old folks move no more, their world's become too small, their bodies feel like lead
They might look out the window or else sit in a chair, or else they stay in bed

And if they still go out, arm in arm, arm in arm, in the morning's chill
It's to have a good cry, to say their last good-bye to one who's older still

And then they go home to the old silver clock, when day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, "Yes," it says, "No," it says, "I'll wait for you"

The old folks never die, they just put down their heads and go to sleep one day
They hold each other's hand like children in the dark, but one will get lost anyway

And the other will remain just sitting in that room, which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now, the song has died away, and echoes all around

You'll see them when they walk through the sun-filled park, where children run and play
It hurts too much to smile, it hurts too much but life goes on for still another day

As they try to escape the old silver clock, when day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, "Yes," it says, "No," it says, "I'll wait for you"

The old, old silver clock that's hanging on the wall, That waits for us all

THE OLD LAMPLIGHTER
	He made the night a little brighter wherever he would go
	The old lamplighter of long, long ago
	His snowy hair was so much whiter beneath the candle glow
     	The old lamplighter of long, long ago
You'd hear the patter of his feet, as he came toddling down the street
     His smile would hide a lonely heart, you see
If there were sweethearts in the park, he'd pass a lamp, and leave it dark
	Remembering the days that used to be
For he recalled when dreams were new, he loved someone who loved him too
     Who walks with him alone, in memory
	He made the night a little brighter wherever he would go
	The old lamplighter of long, long ago
Now, if you look up at the sky, you'll understand the reason why
     The little stars at night are all aglow
He turns them on when night is here, he turns them off when dawn is near
     The little man we'd loved so long ago.
	He made the night a little brighter wherever he would go
	The old lamplighter of long, long ago

OLD MAN
	Old man, look at my life, I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life, twenty-four, and there's so much more
Live alone in a Paradise, that makes me think of two
Love lost, such a cost, give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed, rolling home to you
	Old man, take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you
	I need someone to love me the whole day through
	Ah, one look in my eyes, and you can tell that's true
Lullabies, look in your eyes, run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me, to mean that much to you
I've been first and last, look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last, rolling home to you.
	Old man, take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you
	I need someone to love me the whole day through
	Ah, one look in my eyes, and you can tell that's true
     Old man, look at my life, I'm a lot like you were  (X2)

THE OLD PIANO ROLL BLUES
I wanna hear it again, I wanna hear it again, the old piano roll blues
We're sitting at an upright, my sweetie and me
Pushing on the pedals, making sweet harmony
When we hear rinkity-plink, and we hear plinkity-plink, we cuddle closer, it seems
And while we kiss, kiss, kiss away all our tears, the player piano's playin' razzamatazz
I wanna hear it again, I wanna hear it again, the old piano roll blues, the old piano roll blues

OLD ROCKING CHAIR
Old rocking chair's got me, my cane by my side,
Fetch me that gin, son, 'fore I tan your hide.
Can't get from this cabin, goin' nowhere
Just set me here grabbin' at the flies round this rocking chair

My dear old aunt Harriet, in Heaven she be,
Send me sweet chariot, for the end of the trouble I see
Old rocking chair gets it, judgement day is here
Chained to my rocking chair.

OLD SHEP
When I was a lad, and Old Shep was a pup, over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog, we were both full of fun, we grew up together that way
	I remember the time at the old swimming hole, when I would have drowned beyond doubt
	But Old Shep was right there, to the rescue he came, he jumped in and helped pull me out
As the years fast did roll, Old Shep he grew old, his eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said,  "I can do no more for him, Jim."
	With hands that were trembling, I picked up my gun, and aimed it at Shep's faithful head
	I just couldn't do it, I wanted to run, I wished they would shoot me instead.
He came to my side and he looked up at me, and laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had, I cried so I scarcely could see
Old Shep, he has gone where the good doggies go, and no more with Old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven, there's one thing I know, Old Shep has a wonderful home.

OLD TIME ROCK AND ROLL
Just take those old records off the shelf. I'll sit and listen to 'em by myself
Today's music ain't got the same soul. I like that old time rock 'n' roll
Don't try to take me to a disco. You'll never even get me out on the floor
In ten minutes I'll be late for the door. I like that old time rock 'n' roll
	Still like that old time rock 'n' roll. That kind of music just soothes the soul
	I reminisce about the days of old, with that old time rock 'n' roll
Won't go to hear 'em play a tango. I'd rather hear some blues or funky old soul
There's only one sure way to get me to go. Start playing old time rock 'n' roll
Call me a relic, call me what you will, say I'm old-fashioned, say I'm over the hill
Today's music ain't got the same soul. I like that old time rock 'n' roll
	Still like that old time rock 'n' roll. That kind of music just soothes the soul
	I reminisce about the days of old, with that old time rock 'n' roll

O LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM
O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars so by:
	Yet in thy dark street shineth the everlasting Light;
	The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above,
While mortals sleep and angels keep their watch of wond'ring love.
	O morning stars, together proclaim the holy birth
	And praises sing to God, the King, and peace to men on earth.

OL' MAN RIVER
	Chug chug, rollin' along, chug chug, rollin' along,
	Chug chug, rollin' along, chug chug, rollin' along,
	He's ol' man river, he keeps on just a rollin along, chug chug, rollin' along,
That ol' man river, that ol' man river, he don't say nothin', but he must know somethin'
He's ol' man river, he keeps on just a rollin' along. chug chug, rollin' along,

He don't plant taters, he don't plant cotton, and them that plants 'em are soon forgotten
He's ol' man river, he keeps on just a rollin' along.
	You and me, we sweat and strain, body's all achin', and racked with pain
	Tote that barge, lift that bale, get a little drunk, and you'll land in jail
	I gets weary, sick of tryin', tired of livin', and scared of dyin'
	But ol' man river, he just keeps rollin' along, ol'man river, keeps rollin, ol' man river
He's ol' man river, chug chug, rollin' along, chug chug, rollin' along,
Chug chug, rollin' along, chug chug, rollin' along,
He's ol' man river, chug chug, rollin' along



ON A BUS TO ST. CLOUD
On a bus to St. Cloud, Minnesota, I thought I saw you there
With the snow fallin' down around you, like a silent prayer
Once on a street in New York City, with the jazz and the sin in the air
And once on a cold LA freeway, goin' nowhere
	And it's strange but it's true, I was sure it was you
	Just a face in the crowd, on a bus to St. Cloud
In a church in downtown New Orleans, I got down on my knees and I prayed
And I wept in the arms of Jesus, for the choice you made
We were just gettin' to the good part, just gettin' past the mystery
Oh, and it's just like you. It's just like you to disagree
	And it's strange but it's true, you just slipped out of view
	Like a face in the crowd on a bus to St. Cloud
And you chase me like a shadow, and you haunt me like a ghost
And I hate you so,  and I love you so, and, baby, I miss you most, I miss you most

On a bus to St. Cloud, Minnesota, I thought I saw you there
With the snow fallin' down around you, like a silent prayer

ON A CLEAR DAY
On a clear day, rise and look around you, and you'll see who you are
On a clear day, how it will astound you, that the glow of your being outshines every star
You feel part of every mountain, sea and shore
You can hear, from far and near, a world you've never heard before
And on a clear day, on that clear day, you can see forever and evermore!

ON A SLOW BOAT TO CHINA
I'd love to get you on a slow boat to china, all to my self, alone
Get you and keep you in my arms evermore
Leave all the others waiting on a faraway shore.
Out on the briny with a moon big and shiny melting your heart of stone.
I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China, all to myself alone

ON AND ON
Down in Jamaica they got lots of pretty women
Steal your money, then they break your heart
Lonesome Sue, she's in love with ol' Sam
She takes him from the fire into the fryin' pan
     On and on,  she/he just keeps on trying, and she/he smiles when she/he feels like crying
     On and on, on and on, on and on
Poor ol' Jimmy sits alone in the moonlight, saw his woman kiss another man
So he takes a ladder, steals the stars from the sky, puts on Sinatra and starts to cry
    When the first time is the last time, it can make you feel  so bad
    But if you know it, show it,  hold on tight, don't let her say "Goodnight."
Got the sun on my shoulders and my toes in the sand, woman's left me for some other man
Ah, but I don't care, I'll just dream and stay tanned, toss up my heart and see where it lands.
     On and on, I just keep on trying, and I smile when I feel  like dying
     On and on, on and on, on and on  on and on, on and on, on and on
      On and on, on and on, on and on                       oo oo

ON A WONDERFUL DAY LIKE TODAY
On a wonderful day like today, I defy any cloud to appear in the sky
Dare any raindrop to plop in my eye, on a wonderful day like today

On a wonderful morning like this, when the  sun is as big as a yellow balloon
Even the sparrows are singing in tune, on a wonderful morning like this
	On a morning like this, I could kiss everybody, I'm so full of love and goodwill
	Let me say, furthermore,  I'd adore everybody to come and dine
	The pleasure's mine, and I will pay the bill
May I take this occasion to say that the whole human race should go down on its knees
Show that we're grateful for mornings like these, for the world's in a wonderful way
On a wonderful day like today
	On a morning like this, I could kiss everybody, I'm so full of love and goodwill
	Let me say, furthermore,  I'd adore everybody to come and dine
	The pleasure's mine, and I will pay the bill
May I take this occasion to say that the whole human race should go down on its knees
Show that we're grateful for mornings like these, for the world's in a wonderful way
On a wonderful day like today

ON BROADWAY
They say the neon  lights are bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air on Broadway
But when you're walkin' down the street, and you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off, and you're nowhere.

They say the women treat you fine on Broadway
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues
'Cause how ya gonna make some time,  when all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes.

They say that I won't last too long on Broadway
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they say
But they're dead wrong, I know they are, 'cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway.

ONCE I LOVED
Once  I loved, and I gave so much love to this love, you were the world to me
Once I cried, at the thought I was foolish and proud and let you say goodbye
Then one day, from my infinite sadness you came and brought me love again
Now I know, that no matter what ever befalls I'll never let you go
I will hold you close, make you stay
Because love is the saddest thing when it goes away
Because love is the saddest thing when it goes away

ONCE IN A WHILE
Once in a while will you try to give one little thought to me
Though someone else may be nearer your heart
Once in a while will you dream of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two drifted apart
In love's smoldering ember, one spark may remain
If love still can remember, the spark may burn again
I know that I'll be contented with yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me once in a while

ONCE IN LOVE WITH AMY
Once in love with Amy, always in love with Amy.
Ever and ever fascinated by her, sets your heart on fire to stay
Once you're kissed by Amy, tear up your list, it's Amy
Ply her with bon-bons, poetry and flowers, moon a million hours
	You might be the fickle-hearted rover, so carefree and bold who
	Loves a girl and later thinks it over and just quits cold.
But once in love with Amy, always in love with Amy.
Ever and ever sweetly you'll romance her, trouble with the answer will be
That Amy'd rather stay, Amy'd rather stay, Amy'd.... rather...stay....in....love...with...me.
ONCE UPON A SUMMERTIME
Once upon a summertime, if you recall, we stopped beside a little flower stall
A bunch of bright forget-me-nots was all you'd let me buy you
     Once upon a summertime, just like today, we laughed the happy afternoon away
     And stole a kiss in every street café.
You were sweeter than the blossoms on the tree. I was as proud as any man could be,
As if the Mayor had offered me the key, the key to Paris
     Now, another wintertime has come and gone. The pigeons feeding in the square have flown,
     But I remember, when the vespers chime, you loved me once upon a summertime.

ONCE UPON A TIME
Once upon a time a girl with moonlight in her eyes
Put her hand in mine and said she loved me so
But that was once upon a time, very long ago
Once upon a time we sat beneath a willow tree
Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn
But that was once upon a time, now the tree is gone
	How the breeze ruffled up her hair
	How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there
	We were young and didn't have a care. Where did it go?
Once upon a time the world was sweeter than we knew
Everything was ours, how happy we were then
But somehow once upon a time never comes again

ONE (IS THE LONELIEST NUMBER)
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do.
Two can be as bad as one, it's the loneliest number since the number one

No is the saddest experience you'll ever know
Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know
	'Cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
	One is the loneliest number, whoa-oh, worse than two
     It's just no good anymore since you went away
     Now I spend my time just making rhymes of yesterday
One is the loneliest number, one is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do, number one

ONE FINE DAY
One fine day, you'll look at me, and you will know our love was meant to be
One find day, you're gonna want me for your girl
The arms I long for will open wide, and you'll be proud to have me by your side
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl
	Though I know you're the kind of boy who only wants to run around
	I'll keep waiting, and someday, darling,  you'll come to me when you want to settle down
One fine day, we'll meet once more, and then you'll want the love you threw away before
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl.

ONE FINGER MELODY
Yum dida dida, I love to play this melo-dy,
Yum dida dida, the melody you sang to me.
Here beside my piano, I linger,
Picking out a memory with just one finger.
Yum dida dida, the music brings me close to you,
Maybe if I play it long enough it will come true,
Now you're far a-way and I'm a-lone and so I play
Yum dida dida, da yum dida dida, all day.
Now you're far a-way and I'm a-lone and so I play
Yum dida dida, da yum dida dida, all day.
(Yum dida dida da ooo, yum dida dida da ooo)
Yum dida dida, da ooo.

ONE FOR MY BABY
It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place except you and me
So, set 'em up, Joe, I've got a little story you oughta know
We're drinking, my friend, to the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road.
Got the routine, so drop another nickel in the machine
I'm feelin' so bad, I wish you'd make the music dreamy and sad
Could tell you a lot, but you've got to be true to your code
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road
You'd never know it, but buddy, I'm a kind of poet, and I've gotta lotta things to say
And when I'm gloomy, you simply gotta listen to me, until it's talked away
Well, that's how it goes, and Joe, I know you're getting anxious to close
So, thanks for the beer, I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear
This torch that I've found, must be drowned or it soon might explode
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road, that long, long road.

ONE MEATBALL
A little man walked up and down to find an eating place in town
He read the menu through and through, to see what fifteen cents could do
	One meatball, one meatball, he could afford but one meatball.
He told the waiter near at hand the simple dinner he  had planned.
The guests were startled, one and all, to hear that waiter loudly call,
	"One meatball, one meatball, this here gent wants one meatball."
The little man felt ill at ease,  said, "Some bread, sir, if   you please."
The waiter hollered down the hall, "You get no bread with one meatball."
	"One meat-ball, one meatball, well, you get no bread with one meatball."
The little man felt very bad, one meatball was all he had,
And in his dreams, he hears that call, "You get no bread with one meatball."
	"One meat-ball (and no spa-ghetti!), one meat-ball,
	Well, you get no bread with one       meat-ball."

ONE NOTE SAMBA
This is just a little samba, built upon a single note
Other notes are bound to follow, but the root is still that note
Now this new one is the consequence of the one we've just been through
As I'm bound to be the unavoidable consequence of you
     There're so many people who can talk and talk and talk and just say nothing, or nearly nothing
      I have used up all the scale I know and at the ending I've come to nothing, or nearly nothing
So I come back to my first note, as I must come back to you
I will pour into that one note all the love I feel for you.
Anyone who wants the whole show, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti, Do
He will find himself with no show. Better play the note you know
He will find himself with no show. Better play the note you know
He will find himself with no show. Better play the note you know

ONE OF THESE NIGHTS
One of these nights, one of these crazy old nights
We're gonna find out, pretty mama, what turns on your lights
The full moon is calling, the fever is high, and the wicked wind whispers and moans
You got your demons, you got desires, well, I got a few of my own
	Ooh, someone to be kind to, in between the dark and the light
	Ooh, comin' right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you, one of these nights
One of these dreams, one of these lost and lonely dreams, now
We're gonna find one, mm, one that really screams
I've been searchin' for the daughter of the devil himself
I've been searchin' for an angel in white
I've been waitin' for a woman who's a little of both
And I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight
	Ooh, loneliness will blind you, in between the wrong and the right
	Ooh, comin' right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you, one of these nights

	One of these nights, ooh, in between the dark and the light
	Comin' right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you, get you, baby, one of these nights
	One of these nights (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
	One of these nights (I can feel it, I can feel it)
	One of these nights  (swear I'm gonna find you now)

ONE OF US WAS WRONG
One of us was wrong, and so we parted. One of us was wrong, and now we're through
	Don't know who to blame, but it's all the same
	I just know that I'm alone and blue
One of us was wrong, and so we quarreled.That's the reason nights are, oh, so long
	So I'll find her, and tell her that I'm sorry. One of us was wrong, all wrong  (X2)

ONE SUMMER NIGHT
One summer night, we fell in love, one summer night, I held you tight
You and I, under the moon of love, moon of love

One summer night, I kissed your lips, one summer night, I held you close
You and I, under the moon of love
	You kissed me oh, so tenderly, and I knew this was love
     	And, as I held you, oh so close, I knew no one could ever take your place, ohhhh
One summer night, we fell in love, one summer night, I held you tight
You and I, under the moon of love, moon of love.

ONLY IN AMERICA
Only in America, can a guy from anywhere, go to sleep a pauper and wake up a millionaire
Only in America, can a kid without a cent, get a break and maybe grow up to be President
	Only in America, Land of Opportunity, yeah
	Would a classy girl like you fall for a poor boy like me
Only in America, can a kid who's washin' cars
Take a giant step and reach right up and touch the stars
Only in America, could a dream like this come true
Could a guy like me start with nothing, and end up with you
	Only in America, Land of Opportunity, yeah
	Would a classy girl like you fall for a poor boy like me
(Only in America)  Poor boy like me   (Only in America)  Only in America
(Only in America)  Only in America   (Only in America)

ONLY LOVE CAN BREAK A HEART
	Only love can break a heart, only love can mend it again
Last night I hurt you but darlin' remember this
	Only love can break a heart, only love can mend it again, mm, mm
You know I'm sorry, I'll prove it with just one kiss
	Only love can break a heart, only love can mend it again
Give me a chance to make up for the harm I've done
Try to forgive me and let's keep the two of us one.
Please let me hold you and love you for always and always
	Only love can break a heart only love can mend it again
	Only love can break a heart only love can mend it again

ONLY SIXTEEN
She was only sixteen, only sixteen, I loved her so,
But she was too young to fall in love, and I was too young to know
We'd laugh and we'd sing, and do the little things that made my heart glow
But she was too young to fall in love, and I was too young to know
	Why did I give my heart so fast, it never will happen again
	But I was a mere lad of sixteen, I've aged a year since then
She was only sixteen, only sixteen, with eyes that would glow
But she was too young to fall in love, and I was too young to know
	(But why did you give your heart so fast?) Boy, it never will happen again
	(But you were a mere lad of sixteen) I've aged a year since then
She was only sixteen, only sixteen, with eyes that would glow
But she was too young to fall in love, and I was too young to know
But she was too young to fall in love, and I was too young to know

ONLY THE LONELY
	Dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah, ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah
	Oh-oh-oh-oh-wah, only the lonely, only the lonely
Only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
Know the way I feel tonight (ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah)
Only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
Know this feeling ain't right (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
     There goes my baby, there goes my heart, they're gone forever, so far apart
     But only the lonely know why I cry, only the lonely
	Dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah, ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-wah, only the lonely, only the lonely
Only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
Know the heartaches I've been through (ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah)
Only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
Know I cry and cry for you (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)
     Maybe tomorrow, a new romance, no more sorrow, but that's the chance you gotta take
     If your lonely heart breaks, only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah)

ONLY TRUST YOUR HEART
Never trust the stars when you're about to fall in love
Look for hidden signs before you start to sigh

Never trust the moon when you're about to taste her/his kiss
She/He knows all the lines and she/he knows how to lie
	Just wait for a night when the skies are all bare, then see if you care
Never trust your dreams when you're about to fall in love
For your dreams may quickly fall apart
     So if you're smart, really smart, only trust your heart

ONLY YOU
Only you can make this world seem right, only you can make the darkness bright
Only you and you alone can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart with love for only you

Only you can make this change in me, for it's true, you are my destiny
When you hold my hand I understand the magic that you do
You're my dream come true, my one and only you
You're my dream come true, my one and only you

ON THE FRONT PORCH
	   Three creaky wooden stairs, those squeaky rocking chairs
	   The well worn welcome mat, the lattice vines, the happy times
All I want to do when the day is through, is linger here on the front porch with you
From the wicker swing, while the night birds sing
We'll watch the fireflies sparkin', do some sparkin' too

How the hours fly, as the moon drifts by, how sweet the air, as we stare at the sky
Oh! How I love to linger here like this, hold your hand, and steal a kiss or two
On the  front porch with you

ON THE ROAD AGAIN
On the road again, just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends, and I can't wait to get on the road again.
On the road again, goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again, and I can't wait to get on the road again.
	On the road again, like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
	We're the best of friends, insisting that the world be turnin' our way....and our way
Is on the road again, just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends, and I can't wait to get on the road again
And I can't wait to get on the road again.

ON THE SENTIMENTAL SIDE
If you wonder why I'm near you, even though I've been denied
I'm inclined to be a little on the sentimental side
I suppose I should forget you, if I had an ounce of pride
But I guess I can't help being on the sentimental side
	I should act gay, laugh it off and say, farewell
	Say it just didn't wear well, but I'm not that way
I'm in hopes you'll think it over, and perhaps be satisfied
With a simple sort of person on the sentimental side
	I should act gay, laugh it off and say, farewell
	Say it just didn't wear well, but I'm not that way
I'm in hopes you'll think it over, and perhaps be satisfied
With a simple sort of person on the sentimental side

ON THE STREET WHERE YOU LIVE
I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I  several stories high, knowing I'm on the street where you live
Are there lilac trees in the heart of town
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town
Does enchantment pour out of every door? No, it's just on the street where you live
	Oh, the towering feeling, just to know somehow you are near
	The overpowering feeling that any second you may suddenly appear
People stop and stare, they don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by, I won't care if I can be here on the street where you live

ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET
Grab your coat and get your hat, leave your worries on the doorstep
Just direct your feet to the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter pat and that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet on the sunny side of the street
I used to walk in the shade with the blues on parade
Now I'm not afraid, this rover crossed over
If I never had a cent I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet on the sunny side of the street
On the sunny, on that sunny side of the street.

ON THE WAY TO CAPE MAY
	 You looked so very pretty, when we met in Ocean City, like someone oh so easy to adore.
	 I sang this little ditty, on our way through Ocean City, heading south along the Jersey shore.
On the way to Cape May, I fell in love with you.
On the way to Cape May, I saw my dreams come true.
I was taken by your smile as we drifted by Sea Isle.
My heart was gone when we reached Avalon!

On the way to Cape May, Stone Harbor skies were blue.
We were naming the day, when Wildwood came in view.
If you're gonna be my spouse, we better head for that court house,
On the way to Cape May, on the way to Cape May.

On the way to Cape May, I fell in love with you.
On the way to Cape May, I saw my dreams come true.
I was taken by your smile as we drifted by Sea Isle.
My heart was gone when we reached Avalon!

On the way to Cape May, Stone Harbor skies were blue.
We were naming the day, when Wildwood came in view.
If you're gonna be my spouse, we better head for that court house,
On the way to Cape May, on the way to Cape May.
If you're gonna be my spouse, we better head for that court house,
On the way to Cape May, on the way to Cape May.

ON TOP OF OLD SMOKY
On top of old smoky, all covered with snow,
I lost my true lover, for courtin' too  slow
	For courtin's a pleasure, and parting is grief,
	But a false-hearted lover is worse than a  thief
A thief will just rob you, and take what you have,
But a false-hearted lover will lead you to the grave
	The grave will decay you, and turn you to dust,
	Not one boy in a hundred, a poor girl can trust
They'll hug you and kiss you, and tell you more lies
Than cross-ties on a railroad, or stars in the sky
	So come, all ye maidens, and listen to me
	Never place your affections on a green willow tree
For the leaves they will wither, and the roots they will die
And you'll all be forsaken, and never know why.

ON TOP OF SPAGHETTI
On top of spaghetti, all covered with cheese
I lost my poor meatball when somebody sneezed.
It rolled off the table and on to the floor
And then my poor meatball rolled out of the door.
It rolled in the garden and under a bush
And then my poor meatball was nothing but mush
The mush was as tasty, as tasty could be
And then the next summer it grew into a tree
The tree was all covered, all covered with moss
And on it grew meatballs and tomato sauce
So if you eat spaghetti, all covered with cheese
Hold on to your meatball whenever you sneeze.

OO DE LALLY
Robin Hood and Little John, walkin' through the forest
Laughin' back and forth at what the other'n has to say
Reminiscin' this 'n' that, and havin' such a good time
Oo-de-lally, Oo-de-lally, golly, what a day
	Never ever thinkin' there was danger in the water
	They were drinkin', they just guzzled it down
	Never dreamin' that a schemin' sheriff and his posse
	Was a-watchin' them and gatherin' around
Robin Hood and Little John, runnin' through the forest
Jumpin' fences, dodgin' trees, and tryin' to get away
Contemplatin' nothin' but escapin' and finally makin' it
    Oo-de-lally, Oo-de-lally, golly, what a day

THE OPEN ROAD
Give me the open road, the open road is where I'm bound
I know where it will lead, where it will lead is sacred ground
	No stop signs, no waiting lines, just western pines all around
	Give me the open road, the open road is where I'm bound.
I've seen those city streets, those city streets are not for me
I know where they will lead, and that's no place I want to be
	The rat race, the frantic pace, I need a place to be free
	Give me the open road, the open road is where I'm bound.
Give me the open road, the open road is where I'm bound
I know where it will lead, where it will lead is sacred ground
	No stop signs, no waiting lines, just western pines all around
	Give me the open road, the open road is where I'm bound.
     Guess I've got to roam, 'cause the open road....
     Will lead me ho...........me!

OPERATOR
Operator, well could you help me place this call
See, the number on the match book is old and faded
She's living in L.A. with my best old ex-friend Ray
A guy she said she knew well and sometimes hated
	But isn't that the way they say it goes
	Well, let's forget all that, and give me the number, if you can find it
	So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine, and to show
	I've overcome the blow, I've learned to take it well
	I only wish my words could just convince myself
　　　　That it just wasn't real, but that's not the way it feels
Operator, well could you help me place this call
 'Cause I can't read the number that  you  just  gave me
There's something in my eyes, you know, it happens every time
I think about the love that I thought would save me
	But isn't that the way they say it goes
	Well, let's forget all that, and give me the number, if you can find it
	So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine, and to show
	I've overcome the blow, I've learned to take it well
	I only wish my words could just convince myself
　　　　That it just wasn't real, but that's not the way it feels
	No, no, no, no, that's not the way it feels
Operator, well let's forget about this call
There's no one there I really wanted to talk to
Thank you for your time, ah, you've been so much more than kind. You can keep the dime
 But isn't that the way they say it goes
	But isn't that the way they say it goes
	Well, let's forget all that, and give me the number, if you can find it
	So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine, and to show
	I've overcome the blow, I've learned to take it well
	I only wish my words could just convince myself
　　　　That it just wasn't real, but that's not the way it feels, it's just not the way it feels

OPUS ONE
Oh, baby, I'm wrackin' my brain to think of a name to give to this tune so Perry can croon
And maybe ol' Bing will give it a fling and that'll start everyone hummin' the thing
The melody's dumb, repeat and repeat, but if you can swing, it's got a good beat
And that's the main thing to make it complete when everyone's swingin' today.
So we call it Opus One, it's not for Sammy Kaye, hey, hey, hey.
It's Opus One, got to swing and sway ba – by!
And Mr. Les Brown can make it renowned and Ray Anthony can rock it for me
There's never a doubt, you knock yourself out, whenever you can hear Opus One.
	Instrumental

ORANGE COLORED SKY
I was walkin' along, mindin' my business, when, out of an orange colored sky,
Flash, bam alacazam, wonderful you came by.
I was hummin' a tune, drinkin' in sunshine, when, out of that orange colored view,
Wham, bam, alacazam, I got a look at you.
One look and I yelled "timber, watch out for flyin' glass
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout, "I've been hit, this is it, this is it!"
I was walkin' along, mindin' my business, when love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, bam, alacazam, out of an orange colored sky.
Well, one look and I yelled  (CHORUS)
I was walkin' along, mindin' my business, when love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, bam, alacazam, out of an orange colored, purple striped, pretty, green polka-dot sky.....
Flash, bam, alacazam .....And...good-bye!

ORDINARY MIRACLE
It's not that unusual, when everything is beautiful.
It's just another ordinary miracle today
The sky knows when it's time to snow, don't need to teach a seed to grow
It's just another ordinary miracle today
	Life is like a gift they say, wrapped up for you every day
	Open up and find a way to give some of your own love
Isn't it remarkable, like every time a raindrop falls
It's just another ordinary miracle today
Birds in winter have their fling. They always make it home by spring
It's just another ordinary miracle today
	When you wake up every day, please don't throw your dreams away
	Hold them close to your heart, 'cause we are all a part of the ordinary miracle
	Ordinary miracle... Do you want to see a miracle?
It seems so exceptional, that things just work out after all
It's just another ordinary miracle today

The sun comes up and shines so bright, and disappears again at night
It's just another ordinary miracle today
Ooh...................	It's just another ordinary miracle today

O, SUSANNA
I come from Alabama with a banjo on my knee
I'm going to Lusianna, my true love for to see
It rained all night the day I left, the weather it was dry
The sun so hot I froze to death, Susanna, don't you cry
	O, Susanna, oh don't you cry for me
	'Cause I come from Alabama with an ukulele on my knee
I had a dream the other night when everything was still
I thought I saw Susanna, dear, a'comin' down the hill
A buckwheat cake was in her mouth, a tear was in her eye
Says I, "I'm comin' from the south, Susanna, don't you cry.
  (CHORUS)

OUR DAY WILL COME
Our day will come and we'll have everything
We'll share the joy falling in love can bring
No one can tell me that I'm  too young to know I love you so
And you love me
Our day will come if we just wait a while
No tears for us, think love and wear a smile
Our dreams have magic because we'll always stay in love this way
Our day will come

OUR LOVE AFFAIR (Judy Garland)
	Here we are, two very be-ildered people.
	Here we are, two babes that are lost in the wood
	We're not quite certain what has happened to us
	This lovely thing that's so marvelous
	But right from here, the future looks awfully good.
Our love affair was meant to be. It's me for you dear, and you for me
We'll fuss and quarrel, and tears start to brew, but after the tears, our love will smile through

I'm sure that I could never hide the thrill I get when you're by my side
And when we're older, we'll proudly declare, "Wasn't ours a lovely love affair?"

I'm sure that I could never hide the thrill I get when you're by my side
And when we're older, we'll proudly declare, "Wasn't ours a lovely love affair?"

OUT IN THE COUNTRY
Whenever I need to leave it all behind, or feel the need to get away
I find a quiet place, far from the human race, out in the country
      Before the breathin' air is gone, before the sun is just a bright spot in the nighttime
      Out where the rivers like to run
      I stand alone and take back somethin' worth rememberin'
Whenever I feel them closing in on me, or need a bit of room to move
When life becomes too fast, I find relief at last, out in the country
      Before the breathin' air is gone, before the sun is just a bright spot in the nighttime
      Out where the rivers like to run
      I stand alone and take back somethin' worth rememberin'
And now I need to leave it all behind, I feel the need to get away
I'll find a quiet place, far from the human race, out in the country
      Before the breathin' air is gone, before the sun is just a bright spot in the nighttime
      Out where the rivers like to run
      I stand alone and take back somethin' worth rememberin'

OUT OF NOWHERE
You came to me from out of nowhere. You took my heart and found it free
Wonderful dreams, wonderful schemes from nowhere
Made every hour sweet as a flower for me
If you should go back to your nowhere, leaving me with a memory
I`ll always wait for your return out of nowhere, hoping you`ll bring your love to me

OVER AND OVER
	Ah-mmm, ah-mmm, ah-mmm, ah-mmm
Well, I went to a dance just the other night, everybody there was there
I said over and over and over again,  this dance is gonna be a drag (X3)
	Ah-mmm, ah-mmm, ah-mmm, ah-mmm
All at once it happened, the prettiest in the world
I said a-won't you come over and a-talk to me, and be my girl  (X3)
	Ah-mmm, ah-mmm, ah-mmm, ah-mmm
She said she was sorry, and I was a little bit late
She would a-wait and a-wait and a-wait and a-wait for her steady date  (X3)
	Ah-mmm, ah-mmm, ah-mmm, ah-mmm

OVERJOYED
Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

And though you don't believe that they do, they do come true
For did my dreams come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe, you too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I've sought can never be mine

And though you don't believe that they do, they do come true
For did my dreams come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe, you too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds say improbable, what do they know
For in romance all true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find you too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over you......over you. . . . . .

OVER THE RAINBOW (with verse)
   When all the world is a hopeless jumble and the raindrops tumble all around
       Heaven opens a magic lane
   When all the clouds darken up the skyway, there's a rainbow highway to be found
   Leading from your window pane, to a place behind the sun,
       Just a step beyond the rain....

Somewhere over the rainbow way up high,
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.

Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.
   Someday I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
   Where troubles melt like lemon drops, away above the chimney tops
   That's where you'll find me.
Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly, birds fly over the rainbow,
Why oh why can't I?

OVER THE RIVER AND THROUGH THE WOODS
Over the river and through the woods, to Grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh through white and drifted snow
Over the river and through the woods, oh, how the wind does blow
It stings the toes, and bites the nose, as over the ground we go

Over the river and through the woods, and straight through the barnyard gate
It seems that we go so dreadfully slow, it's so hard to wait
Over the river and through the woods, now Grandma's cap I spy
Hooray for fun, is the pudding done, hooray for the pumpkin pie
Hooray for fun, is the pudding done, hooray for the pumpkin pie

PACK UP YOUR SORROWS
	If somehow you could    pack up your sorrows, and give them all to me,
	You would lose them, I know how to use them, give them all to me.
No use crying, talking to a stranger, naming the sorrows you've seen.
Oh, 'cause there's  too many bad times, too many sad times, and nobody knows what you mean.
	 CHORUS
No use rambling, walking in the shadows, trailing a wandering star.
No one beside you, no one to hide you, nobody knows where you are.
	CHORUS
 No use roaming, walking by the roadside, seeking a satisfied mind.
Ah, but there's  too many highways, too many byways, and nobody walking behind.
	CHORUS

PADDLIN' MADELIN' HOME
	I love a girl named Madeline. I know she loves me, too
	For every night the moon is bright, she rides in my canoe
	At midnight, on the river, I heard her father call
	But she don't care, and I don't care if we get back at all
 'Cause when I'm paddlin' Madelin' home, gee! when I'm paddlin' Madelin' home
First, I drift with the tide, then pull for the shore
I hug her and kiss her and paddle some more

Then I keep paddlin' Madelin' home, until I find a spot where we're alone
Oh! she never says 'no', so I kiss her and go
Paddlin' Madelin', sweet, sweet Madelin,' paddlin' Madelin' home

While I'm paddlin' Madelin' home, gee! when I'm paddlin' Madelin' home
First, I kiss her a while, and when I get through
I paddle for one mile, and   drift back for two
Then I keep paddlin' Madelin' home, until I find a spot where we're alone
Oh! If she'd only say throw your paddles away
Paddlin' Madelin', sweet, sweet Madelin,' paddlin' Madelin' home

PAINTED, TAINTED ROSE
She was a wild and lovely rose
Oh, how I loved her, heaven knows
But though my heart was true, it would never do
Party life was what she chose
Last night I saw my lovely rose
All painted up in fancy clothes
Her eyes had lost their spark, the years had left their mark
She's just a painted, tainted rose

PALISADES PARK
Last night I took a walk after dark, a swingin' place called Palisades Park
To have some fun and see what I could see -That's where the girls are!
I took a ride on a shoot-the-chute, that girl I sat beside was awful cute
And when we stopped she was holdin' hands with me-My heart was flyin'
	Up like a rocket ship, down like a roller coaster
	Back like a loop-the-loop, and a-round like a merry-go-round
We ate at eight at a hot dog stand, we danced around to a rockin' band
And when I could, I gave that girl a hug-In the tunnel of love
You'll never know how great a kiss can feel, when you stop at the top of a Ferris wheel
When I fell in love-down at Palisades Park

PAPA LOVES MAMBO
Papa loves mambo, mama loves mambo
Look at 'em sway with it, gettin' so gay with it, shoutin' Ole with it, wow!

Papa loves mambo (papa loves mambo), mama loves mambo (mama loves mambo)
Papa does great with it, swings like a gate with it, evens his weight with it, now!
	He goes to, she goes fro, he goes fast, she goes slow, he goes left, she goes right
	Papa's lookin' for mama, but mama is nowhere in sight!
Papa loves mambo, mama loves mambo
Havin' their fling again, younger than Spring again, feelin' that zing again, wow!

Papa loves mambo (papa loves mambo), mama loves mambo (mama loves mambo)
Don't let her rumba, and don't let her samba, 'cause papa loves mama tonight!
	He goes to, she goes fro, he goes fast, she goes slow, he goes left, she goes right
	Papa's lookin' for mama, but mama is nowhere in sight!
(Papa loves mambo) mambo papa, (mama loves mambo) mambo mama
(Don't let her rumba, and don't let her samba), papa...loves the mambo tonight!

PAPER DOLL
I'm goin' to buy a paper doll that I can call my own, a doll that other fellows cannot steal
And then those, flirty, flirty guys, with their flirty, flirty eyes will have to flirt with dollies that are real
When I come home at night she will be waiting, she'll be the truest doll in all the world
I'd rather have a paper doll to call my own than have a fickle-minded real live girl

I guess I've had a million dolls or more, I guess I've played the doll game o'er and o'er
I just quarreled with Sue, that's why I'm blue; She's gone away and left me just like all dolls do.
I'll tell you, boys, it's tough to be alone, and it's tough to love a doll that's not your own.
I'm through with all of them, I'll never fall again, 'cause this is what I'll do......

I'm goin' to buy a paper doll that I can call my own, a doll that other fellows cannot steal
And then those, flirty, flirty guys, with their flirty, flirty eyes will have to flirt with dollies that are real
When I come home at night she will be waiting, she'll be the truest doll in all the world
I'd rather have a paper doll to call my own than have a fickle-minded real live girl.

PAPER ROSES
I realize the way your eyes deceived me, with tender looks that I mistook for love
So take away the flowers that you gave me, and send the kind that you remind me of
	Paper Roses, Paper Roses, oh, how real those roses seem to be
	But they're only imitation, like your imitation love for me
I thought that you would be a perfect lover, you seemed so full of sweetness at the start
But like a big red rose that's made of paper, there isn't any sweetness in your heart
	Paper Roses, Paper Roses, oh, how real those roses seem to be
	But they're only imitation, like your imitation love for me

PART-TIME LOVE
I need somebody who's consistent with me
Someone already there when I need company
'Cause when l'm feelin' low I don't want to have to go out lookin' for a part-time kind of love

And when the dreams and rainbows start to disappear
Don't want somebody up and runnin' outa here
'Cause when you stop and start, baby, it's just too hard upon my heart, that part-time kind of love
	And I can't take you darlin' livin' here wait and see
	I want somebody who's committed now to me
	Somewhere, someday you'll have to take a chance
	So if you like the music baby get up and dance
And if we grow together daring to dream
I know we'll find our shares of peaches and cream
And when the juices flow I don't want no no no excuses Just want your full time love for me
Just want your full time love for me.

PART-TIME LOVER
Call up, ring once, hang up the phone, to let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
If she's with me, I'll blink the lights to let you know tonight's the night
For me and you, my part-time lover
	We are under-cover passion on the run, chasing love, up against the sun
	We are strangers by day, lovers by night, knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right
If I'm with friends, and we should meet, just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's discreet when part-time lovers
But if there's some emergency, have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek, it's really you, my part-time lover
	We are under-cover passion on the run, chasing love, up against the sun
	We are strangers by day, lovers by night, knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right
I've got something that I must tell, last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you, my part-time lover
And then a man called our exchange, but didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game of part time lover
You and me, part-time lover, me and he, part-time lover

PARTY DOLL
Well, all I want is a party doll, to come along with me when I'm feelin' wild
To be ever lovin, true and fair, to run her fingers through my hair
	Come along and be my party doll,  come along and be my party doll,
	Come along and be my party doll, I'll make love to you, to you, I'll make love to you
Well, I saw a gal walkin' down the street, the kind of gal I'd love to meet
She had blonde hair and eyes of blue, baby, I wanna have a party with you,
	Chorus
Every man has gotta have a party doll, to be with him when he's feelin' wild
To be ever lovin', true and fair, to run her fingers through his hair
To run her fingers through her hair
	Chorus

AT THE HOP
Well, you can rock it, you can roll it, do the stomp, and even  stroll it, at the hop
When the record starts spinnin', you calypso when you chicken, at the hop
Do the dance sensation that is sweepin' the nation, at the hop
	Let's go to the hop, let's go to the hop, oh baby,
	Let's go to the hop, oh baby, let's go to the hop. Come on, let's go to the hop
Well, you can swing it, you can groove it, you can really start to move it, at the hop
Where the jockey is the smoothest, and the music is the coolest, at the hop
All the cats and chicks can get their kicks, at the hop

PASS ME BY
I got me ten fine toes to wiggle in the sand, lots of idle fingers snap to my command.
A loverly pair of heels that kick to beat the band, contemplatin', nature can be fascinatin'.
Add to these a nose that I can thumb, and a mouth, by gum, have I,
To tell the whole darn world, "If you don't happen to like it,
Deal me out, thank you kindly, pass me by!"
	Pass me by-y, pass me by-y-y, if you don't happen to like it, pass me by.
Behold me two great shoes that never saw a shine, trousers I can hold up with a laundry line.
A loverly patch that hides an awful lot of spine, shirt-tails flyin', I'm a bloomin' dandelion!
Add to these a grin from ear to ear, all the proper gear have I,
To tell the whole darn world, "If you don't like the assortment,
Deal me out, thank you kindly, pass me by!"
	Pass me by-y, pass me by-y-y, if you don't happen to like it, pass me by!
	Pass me by-y, pass me by-y-y, if you don't happen to like it, pass me by!

PEACEFUL
In the mornin' fun, when no one will be drinkin' anymore wine
I wake the sun up, by givin' him a fresh air full of the wind cup

And I won't be found in the shadows hiding sorrow
I can wait for fate to bring to me any part of my tomorrow, tomorrow
	'Cause it's oh, so peaceful here
	No one bendin' over my shoulder, nobody breathin' in my ear
	Oh, so peaceful here
In the evenin' shadows are callin' me, and the dew settles in my mind
And I think of friends in the yesterday, when my plans were giggled in rhyme

I had a son, while on the run, and his love brought a tear to my eye
And maybe some day he might say that I'm a pretty nice guy, oh, oh my
	'Cause it's oh, so peaceful here
	No one bendin' over my shoulder, nobody breathin' in my ear
	Oh, so peaceful here

PEACEFUL EASY FEELING
I like the way your sparklin' earrings lay, against your skin so brown
And I wanna sleep with you in the desert tonight, with a billion stars all around
	'Cause I got a peaceful easy feelin' and I know you won't let me down
	'Cause I'm already standin' on the ground
I found out a long time ago what a woman can do to your soul
Ah, but she can't take you anywhere, you don't already know how to go
	And I got a peaceful easy feelin' and I know you won't let me down
	'Cause I'm already standin' on the ground
I get this feelin' I may know you, as a lover and a friend
But this voice keeps whispering in my other ear
Tells me I may never see you again
	'Cause I got a peaceful easy feelin' and I know you won't let me down
	'Cause I'm already standin,' yes I'm already standin',
	I'm already standin' on the ground....ooo   ooo.

PEARLY SHELLS
Pearly shells from the ocean shining in the sun, covering the shore
When I see them my heart tells me that I love you more than all the little pearly shells.
	For every grain of sand upon the beach, I've got a kiss for you
	And I've got more left over for each star that twinkles in the blue.
Pearly shells from the ocean shining in the sun, covering the shore
When I see them my heart tells me that I love you more than all the little pearly shells.
More than all the little pearly shells.

PEGGY SUE
If you knew Peggy Sue, then you'd know why I feel blue
About Peggy, my Peggy Sue.......
Oh, well, I love you, gal, yes, I love you, Peggy Sue
Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue, oh, how my heart yearns for you,
Oh, Pa-heg-gy, my Pa-heg-gy Sue.....
Oh, well, I love you, gal, yes, I love you, Peggy Sue
	Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty Peggy Sue,
	Oh Peggy, my Peggy Sue........
	Oh, well, I love you, gal, and I need you, Peggy Sue
I love you, Peggy Sue, with a love so rare and true
Oh, Peggy, my Peggy Sue........
Oh, well, I love you, gal, and I want you Peggy Sue

PEG O' MY HEART
Peg o' my heart, I love you, we'll never part, I love you
Dear little girl, sweet little girl,
Sweeter than the rose of Erin, are your winning smiles endearing.
Peg o' my heart, your glances with Irish art entrance us,
Come, be my own, come, make your home in my heart.

PENNIES FROM HEAVEN
Every time it rains it rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven
You'll find your fortune falling all over town
Just be sure that your umbrella is upside down
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you must have showers
So, if you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me.

PEOPLE
People, people who need people, are the luckiest people in the world
We're children needing other children,
And yet, letting our grown-up pride hide all the need inside,
Acting more like children than children

Lovers are very special people, they're the luckiest people in the world
With one person, one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul says you were half, now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst, but first be a person who needs people
People who need people are the luckiest people in the world.

PEOPLE GOT TO BE FREE
	All the world over, so easy to see,  people everywhere just wanna be free
	Listen, please listen, that's the way it should be, peace in the valley, people got to be free
You should see what a lovely, lovely world this would be
Everyone learns to live together
Seems to me such an easy, easy thing it should be
Why can't you and me learn to love one another
	All the world over, so easy to see,  people everywhere just wanna be free
	I can't understand, it's so simple to me, people everywhere just gotta be free
If there's a man who is down and needs a helping hand
All it takes is you to understand and to pull him through
Seems to me we got to solve it individual-ly
And I'll do unto you what you do to me
	There'll be shouting from the mountains on out to sea (out to sea)
	No two ways about it, people have to be free (they got to be free)
	Ask me my opinion, my opinion will be (ah-ha)
	It's a natural situation for a man to be free

	Oh, what a feeling just come over me, it's enough to move a mountain, make a blind man see
	Everybody's dancing, we can all see peace in the valley, now they want to be free
	All the world over, so easy to see,  people everywhere just wanna be free
	I can't understand, it's so simple to me, people everywhere just gotta be free

PEOPLE WILL SAY WE'RE IN LOVE
Don't throw bouquets at me, don't please my folks too much,
Don't laugh at my jokes too much, people will say we're in love.
Don't sigh and gaze at me, your sighs are so like mine,
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine, people will say we're in love.
	Don't start collecting things, give me my rose and my glove,
	Sweetheart, they're suspecting things, people will say we're in love.
Don't praise my charm to much, don't look so vain with me,
Don't stand in the rain with me, people will say we're in love.
Don't take my arm too much, don't keep your hand in mine,
Your hand feels so grand in mine, people will say we're in love.
	Don't dance all night with me, till the stars fade from above,
	They'll see it's alright with me, people will say we're in love.

PERFIDIA
To you my heart cries out, "Perfidia,"
For I found you, the love of my life, in somebody else's arms
Your eyes are echoing "Perfidia,"
Forgetful of our promise of love, you're sharing another's charms
	With a sad lament my dreams have faded like a broken melody
	While the gods of love look down and laugh at what romantic fools we mortals be
And now I know my love is not for you
And, so I take it back with a sigh, Perfidious one, goodbye!

PERSONALITY
Over and over, I tried to prove my love to you, over and over, what more can I do
Over and over, my friend says I'm a fool, but over and over, I'll be a fool for you.
'Cause you've got personality, walk with personality,
Talk with personality, smile with personality, charm with personality
Love, with personality, and plus, you've got a great big heart
So over and over, oh, I'll be a fool for you, now over and over, what more can I do
'Cause you've got personality, walk with personality,
Talk with personality, smile with personality, charm with personality
Love, with personality, and plus, you've got a great big heart
So over and over, oh, I'll be a fool for you, now over and over, what more can I do
Over and over, I said that I loved you, over and over, honey, love, it's the truth
Over and over, they still said I'm a fool, but over and over, I'll be a fool for you.
'Cause you've got personality, walk with personality,
Talk with personality, smile with personality, charm with personality
Love, with personality, and plus, you've got a great big heart
So over and over, oh, I'll be a fool for you, now over and over, what more can I do

PHOTOGRAPHS AND MEMORIES
Photographs and memories, Christmas cards you sent to me
All that I have are these to remember you
Memories that come at night, take me to another time
Back to a happier day, when I called you mine
	But we sure had a good time when we started way back when
	Morning walks and bedroom talks, oh, how I loved you then
Summer skies and lullabyes, nights we couldn't say goodbye
And of all of the things that we knew, not a dream survived

Photographs and memories, all the love you gave to me
Somehow it just can't be true. It's all I've left of you
	But we sure had a good time when we started way back when
	Morning walks and bedroom talks, oh, how I loved you then

PICK YOURSELF UP
Nothing's impossible I have found, for when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up, dust myself off, start all over again.
Don't lose your confidence if you slip, be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up, dust yourself off, start all over again.
Work like a soul inspired, till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired, but you'll be a man, my son.
Will you remember the famous men, who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath, dust yourself off, start all over again,
Start all over again,         start all over a-gain.

PINA COLADA SONG (ESCAPE)
I was tired of my lady, we'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleepin' I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns, there was this letter I read

If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga, if you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight in the dunes of the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me and escape

I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half bad

Yes, I like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's where we'll plan our escape

So I waited with high hopes and she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady and she said, "oh, it's you."
Then we laughed for a moment and I said, "I never knew."

That you like piña coladas and gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean and the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for, come with me and escape

If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga, if you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me and escape

A PLACE IN THE SUN
Like a long lonely stream, I keep runnin' towards a dream, movin' on, movin' on
Like a branch on a tree,  I keep reachin' to be free,  movin' on, movin' on
	'Cause there's a place in the sun, where there's hope for everyone
	Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
	There's a place in the sun, and before my life is done, got to find me a place in the sun
Like an old dusty road, I get weary from the load, movin' on, movin' on
Like this tired troubled earth, I've been rollin' since my birth, movin' on, movin' on
	There's a place in the sun, where there's hope for everyone
	Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
	There's a place in the sun, and before my life is done, got to find me a place in the sun
You know when times are bad, and you're feeling sad, I want you to always remember
	Yes, there's a place in the sun, where there's hope for everyone
	Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
	There's a place in the sun, and before my life is done, got to find me a place in the sun

PLACES IN MY PAST
There are ladies in my life, lovely ladies in these lazy days.
And, though I never took a wife, may I say that I have loved me one or two.

Of the people in my past, fading faces in a waking dream,
And, though they never seemed to last very long,
There are faces I remember from the places in my past.
	I said all the dead head miles and the insincere smiles.
	Sometimes I can laugh and cry, and I can't remember why. But, I still love those
Good times gone by, hold on to them close or let them go, oh no.
I don't know, I just seem to sing these songs, and say I'm sorry for the friends I used to know.

PLANT A RADISH
Plant a radish, get a radish, never any doubt.
That's why I love vegetables. You know what you're a-bout!
Plant a turnip. Get a turnip. Maybe you'll get two.
That's why I love vegetables. You know that they'll come through!

They're dependable! They're befriendable! They're the best pal a parent's ever known!
While, with childeren, it's bewilderin'.
You don't know until the seed is nearly grown just what you've sown.

So, plant a carrot, get a carrot, not a Brussels sprout.
That's why I love vegetables. You know what you're about!
Life is merry, if it's very vegetarian!
A man who plants a garden is a very happy man!

Plant a beanstalk, get a beanstalk, just the same as Jack.
Then, if you don't like it, you can always take it back!
But, if your issue doesn't kiss you, then I wish you luck.
For once you've planted children, you're absolutely stuck!
Every turnip green! Every kidney bean! Every plant grows according to the plot!
While with progeny, it's hodge-podgeny.
For as soon as you think you know what kind you've got, it's what they're not!

So, plant a cabbage, get a cabbage, not a sauerkraut!
That's why I love vegetables. You know what you're about!
Life is merry, if it's very vegetarian!
A man who plants a garden is a very happy man!
A vegitari, very merry ve..ge...ta...ri....an!

PLAY A SIMPLE MELODY
Won't you play a simple melody, like my mother sang to me
One with a good old-fashioned harmony, play some simple melody.

Musical demons set your honey a-dreamin', won't you play me some rag
Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from the topsy of a tune that is chop see you'll get all my applause
And that is simply because I wanna listen to rag.

PLEASE BE KIND
This is my first affair, so please be kind
Handle my heart with care, oh, please be kind
This is all so grand, my dreams are on parade
If you'll just understand, they'll never, never fade

So tell me your love's sincere, oh, please be kind
Tell me I needn't fear, oh, please be kind
For if you leave me, dear, I know my heart will lose its mind
If you love me, please  be kind.

PLEASE COME TO BOSTON
Please come to Boston for the springtime
I'm stayin' here with some friends and they've got lots of room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk,  by a cafe where I hope to be workin' soon
Please come to Boston, she said "No, but you come home to me."
	And she said "Hey, ramblin' boy, now won't ya settle down?
	Boston/Denver/LA ain't your kinda town
	There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
	I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennes-see
Please come to Denver with the snow fall
We'll move up into the mountains so far that we can't be found
And throw "I love you" echoes down the canyon
And then lie awake at night, until they come back around
Please come to Denver, she said "No, boy, would you come home to me?"
      CHORUS
	Now this drifter's world goes 'round and 'round, and I doubt that it's ever gonna stop
	But of all the dreams I've lost or found, and all that I ain't got
	I still need to lean to, somebody I can sing to
Please come to L.A., to live for-ever, California life alone is just too hard to build
We'll live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky, and livin' up on the hill
Please come to L.A., she just said, "No, boy, won't you come home to me?"
        CHORUS

PLEASE DON'T TALK ABOUT ME WHEN I'M GONE
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone,
Oh, Honey, though our friendship ceases from now on,
And listen, if you can't say anything real nice,
It's better not to talk at all is my advice.
	We're parting, you go your way, I'll go mine, it's best that we do
	Here's a kiss, I hope that this brings lots of luck to you
Makes no diff'rence how I carry on
Remember, please don't talk about me when I'm gone

PLEASE HELP ME, I'M FALLIN'
Please help me I'm fallin' in love with you
Close the door to temptation, don't let me walk through
Turn away from me, darlin', I'm beggin' you to
Please help me I'm fallin' in love with you

I belong to another who's arms have grown cold
But I promised forever  to have and to hold
I can never be free dear, but when I'm with you
I know that I'm losin' the will to be true

Please help me I'm fallin' and that would be sin
Close the door to temptation, don't let me walk in
For I mustn't want you but, darlin', I do
Please help me I'm fallin' in love with you

PLEASE, MR. POSTMAN

 So many days you passed me by,       and saw the tears standing in my eyes
 You didn't stop to make me feel better,     by leaving me a card or letter
 Mister Postman, look and see,        is there a letter, oh, yeah, for me
 I've been waiting a long, long time,      since I heard from that girlfriend of mine

Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you

POCKETFUL OF RAINBOWS
I don't worry, whenever skies are gray above
Got a pocketful of rainbows, got a heart full of love
Mister Heartache, I've found a way to make him leave
Got a pocketful of rainbows, got a star up my sleeve
	Kiss me extra tender, hold me extra tight
	'Cause I'm savin' your sweetness for a lonely night, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
No more teardrops, now that I've found a love so true
Got a pocketful of rainbows, and an armful of you
	Kiss me extra tender, hold me extra tight
	'Cause I'm savin' your sweetness for a lonely night, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
No more heartaches, now that I've found a love so true
I got a pocketful of rainbows, and an armful of you
	Rainbows, rainbow, rainbows, (fade)

POEMS, PRAYERS, AND PROMISES
I've been lately think-ing about my life's  time, all the things I've done and how it's been,
And I can't help believin' in my own mind, I know I'm gonna hate to see it end.
I've seen a lot of sunshine, slept out in the rain, spent a night or two all on my own
I've known my lady's pleasures, had myself some friends, spent a time or two in my own home.
	I have to say it now it's been a good life, all in all,
	It's really fine to have a chance to hang a-round.
	And lie there by the fire and watch the evening tire,
	While all my friends and my old lady sit and pass the pipe a-round

	And talk of poems and prayers and promises, and things that we believe in,
	How sweet it is to love someone, how right it is to care
	How long it's been since yesterday, what about tomorrow
	And what about our dreams and all the memories we share
Days they pass so quickly now, the nights are seldom long, time around me whispers when it's cold.
The changes somehow frighten me, still I have to smile, it turns me on to think of growing old.
Tho' my life's been good to me, there's still so much to do, so many things my mind has never known
I'd like to raise a family, I'd like to sail away, dance across the mountains on the moon.

POETRY IN MOTION
        When I see my baby, what do I see? Poetry! Poetry in motion!       
Poetry in motion, walking by my side, her lovely locomotion, keeps my eyes open wide.
Poetry in motion, see her gentle sway! A wave out on the ocean, could never move that way. 
   I love every movement, there's nothing I would change,
   She doesn't need improvement, she's much too nice to rearrange ! 
Poetry in motion, dancing close to me, a flower of devotion, a-swaying gracefully.
   Whoa, whoa, whoa, etc....      
Poetry in motion, all that I adore, no number 9 love potion could make me love her more.

I'M TELLING YOU NOW
I'm telling you now, I'm telling you right away,
I'll be staying for many a day, I'm in love with you now.
I'm telling you now, I'll say what you want to hear,
I'll be telling you for many a year, I'm in love with you now.
    Do you think I'm fooling when I say, I love you, I  love you!
    Maybe you'll believe me when I'm finally through, through, through  through!
I'm telling you now, I know it's been said before,
Say you love me and I will be sure, I'm in love with you now.

POINCIANA
	Blow, tropic wind, sing a song through the trees
	Trees, sigh to me, soon my love I will see
Poinciana, your branches speak to me of love, pale moon is casting shadows from above
Poinciana, somehow I feel the jungle heat, within me there grows a rhythmic savage beat
	Love is everywhere, its magic perfume fills the air
	To and fro you sway, my heart's in time, I've learned to care
Poinciana, though skies may turn from blue to gray, my love will live forever and a day
	Blow, tropic wind, sing a song through the trees
	Trees, sigh to me, soon my love I will see. Poinciana

POISON IVY
She comes up like a rose, but everybody knows
She'll get you in love, you can look but you better not touch
Poison ivy, poison ivy, late at night while you're sleepin, p. ivy comes a'creepin around
She's pretty as a daisy, but look out, man, she's crazy
She'll really do you in, if you let her get under your skin.
Poison ivy, poison ivy, late at night while you're sleepin', p. ivy comes a'creepin around
       	Measles make you bumpy, and mumps'll make you lumpy
And chicken pox'll make you jump and twitch
A common cold will fool ya' and whoopin' cough will cool ya'
But poison ivy's gonna make you itch.
You're gonna need an ocean of calamine lotion
You'll be scratchin' like a hound the minute you start to mess around
Poison ivy, poison ivy, late at night while you're sleepin, p. ivy comes a'creepin around
Ya da ya da ya da, ya da ya da ya da

POLKA DOTS AND MOONBEAMS
A country dance was being held in a garden.
I felt a bump and heard an "Oh, beg your pardon."
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams all around a pugnosed dream.
The music started, and was I the perplexed one.
I held my breath and said, "May I have the next one?"
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams sparkled on a pugnosed dream.
	There were questions in the eyes of other dancers, as we floated over the floor.
	There were questions but my heart knew all the answers, and perhaps a few things more.
Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter I know the meaning of the words,  "Ever after."
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams when I kiss the pugnosed dream.

POLLY VON
I shall tell of a hunter whose life was undone
By the cruel hand of evil at the setting of the sun
His arrow was loosed and it flew through the dark,
And his true love was slain as the shaft found it's mark.
	She'd her apron wrapped about her and he took her for a swan
	But it's oh and alas it was she, Polly Von
He ran up beside her and found it was she
He turned away his head for he could not bear to see
He lifted her up and found she was dead,
A fountain of tears for his true love, he shed.
	She'd her apron...
He bore her away to his home by the sea
Cryin' "Father, oh father, I murdered poor Polly!
I've killed my fair love in the flower of her life!
I always intended that she be my wife."
	"But she'd her apron wrapped about her, and I took her for a swan,
	And it's oh and alas it was she, Polly Von."
He roamed near the place where his true love was slain
He wept bitter tears, but his cries were all in vain.
As he looked on the lake, a swan glided by
And the sun slowly sank in the grey of the sky.
	She'd her apron...

POOR LITTLE FOOL
I used to play around with hearts that hastened at my call,
But when I met that little girl I knew that I would fall.
   Poor little fool, oh yeah,  I was a fool, uh huh.. (uh huh, poor little fool, I was a fool, oh yeah)
She'd play around and tease me with her carefree devil eyes,
She'd hold me close and kiss me, but her heart was full of lies.
   Poor little fool, oh yeah,  I was a fool, uh huh.. (uh huh, poor little fool, I was a fool, oh yeah)
She told me how she cared for me, and that we'd never part,
And so for the very first time I gave away my heart.
   Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh.. (uh huh, poor little fool, I was a fool, oh yeah)
The next day she was gone, and I knew she'd lied to me,
She left me with a broken heart, and won her victo-ry.
   Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh.. (uh huh, poor little fool, I was a fool, oh yeah)
Well, I'd played this game with other hearts, but I never thought I'd see,
The day that someone else would play love's foolish game with me.
   Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh.. (uh huh, poor little fool, I was a fool, oh yeah)
   Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh.. (uh huh, poor little fool, ooo)

THE POOR SIDE OF TOWN
How can you tell me how much you miss me
When the last time I saw you, you wouldn't even kiss me
That rich guy you've been seein' must have put you down
So, welcome back, baby, to the poor side of town

To him you were nothin' but a little plaything,
Not much more than an overnight fling
To me you were the greatest thing this boy had ever found
And, girl, it's hard to find nice things on the poor side of town
	I can't blame you for tryin', I'm tryin' to make it too
	I've got one little hang up, baby, I just can't make it without you
So, tell me, are you gonna stay now? Will you stand by me, girl, all the way now
With you by my side, they can't keep us down
Together we can make it, baby, from the poor side of town
Oh, with you by my side, this world can't keep us down
Together we can make it, baby, from the poor side of town

POPSICLE TOES
And when God gave out rhythm, he sure was good to you
You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide by two
I know today's your birthday, and I did not buy no rose
But I wrote this song instead, and I call it Popsicle Toes
	Popsicle Toes.....Popsicle Toes are always froze
	Popsicle Toes.....You're so brave to expose all those Popsicle Toes
You must have been Miss Pennsylvania, with all this pulchritude
How come you always load your Pentax, when I'm in the nude
We ought to have a birthday party, and you can wear your birthday clothes
Then we can hit the floor, and go explore those Popsicle Toes
	Popsicle Toes.....Popsicle Toes are always froze
	Popsicle Toes.....You're so brave to expose all those Popsicle Toes
You got the nicest North America this sailor ever saw
I like to feel your warm Brazil and touch your Panama
But your Tierra del Fuegos are nearly always froze
We gotta see-saw until we unthaw those Popsicle Toes
	Popsicle Toes.....Popsicle Toes are always froze
	Popsicle Toes.....You're so brave to expose all those Popsicle Toes

POWDER YOUR FACE WITH SUNSHINE
Powder your face with sunshine, put on a great big smile
Make up your eyes with laughter, folks will be laughing with you in a little while
Whistle a tune of gladness, blue never was in style
The future's brighter when hearts are lighter, so smile, smile, smile

A PRAIRIE LULLABY
Shadows slow-ly creeping down the prai-rie trail, every-thing is sleeping - all but the nightin-gale
Moon will soon be climbing in the pur-ple sky, night winds all   a-humming this tender lulla-by.
	Cares of the day have fled, my little sleepy-head, the stars are in the sky
	Time that your prayers were said, my little sleepy-head, to a prairie lulla-by
	Saddle up your pony, the Sandman's here to guide you down the trail of dreams
	Tumble in bed, my child, little old sleepy-head, to a prairie lulla-by

PRETEND
Pretend you're happy when you're blue, it isn't very hard to do
And you'll find happiness without an end, if only you pretend.
Remember, anyone can dream, and nothing's bad as it may seem
The little things you haven't got could be a lot if you pretend.
	You'll find a love you can share, one you can call all your own
	Just close your eyes, she'll be there, you'll never be alone
And if you sing this melody, you'll be pretending, just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend, so why don't you pretend.

PRETTY BABY
Everybody loves a baby, that's why I'm in love with you, pretty baby, pretty baby.
And I'd like to be your sister, brother, dad and mother, too, pretty baby, pretty baby.
	Won't you come and let me rock you in my cradle of love, and we'll cuddle all the time.
Oh, I want a lovin' baby and it might as well be you,
Pretty baby of....pretty baby of.....pretty baby of mine.

PRETTY PAPER
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue. Wrap your presents to your darling, from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you. Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
	Crowded street, busy feet, hustle by him, downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh
	There he sits all alone on the sidewalk, hoping that you won't pass him by
     Should you stop? Better not, much too busy. You'd better hurry, my, how time does fly
     In the distance, the ringing of laughter, and, in the midst of the laughter, he cries
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue. Wrap your presents to your darling, from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you. Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue

PRIDE AND JOY
You are my pride and joy, and I just love you, love you, darlin', like a baby boy loves his toy
You've got kisses sweeter than honey, and I work every day to give you all I know
And that's why you're my pride and joy
     I'm tellin' the world: You're my (pride and joy) pride and joy (pride and joy)
     And I believe I'm your (baby boy) baby boy (baby boy)
     And I know you're my (pride and joy), my pride and joy (pride and joy)
     Yeah, baby (baby boy) Yeah, baby (baby boy)
You, you are my pride and joy. and a love like mine, yeah, baby
Is something nobody can ever destroy
You pick me up (pick me up) when I'm down (when I'm down)
And when we go out, pretty baby, you shake up the whole darn town
And that's why (that's why) I believe you're my (you're my) you're my pride and joy (pride and joy)
     Yeah, baby! I believe you're my (pride and joy), you're my pride and joy (pride and joy)
     Every day (pride and joy), and in the night too (pride and joy)
     And I know (baby boy), your little baby boy (b b), and you're my (p&j) my pride and joy (p & j)
     And I love you, just like a schoolboy loves his toy (pride and joy)

     Tell 'em again, tell 'em a-gain (pride and joy), I believe you're my (pride and joy)
     I believe you're my (pride and joy), you're my pride and joy (pride and joy)
     Oh, Lord, I'm your baby boy (baby boy), all because you're my (p & j) you're my pride and joy
     And I love you, just like a schoolboy loves his toy (pride and joy, pride and joy)

PROBLEMS
Problems, problems, problems all day long, will my problems work out right or wrong
My baby don't like anything I do my teacher seems to feel the same way too

Worries, worries pile up on my head, woe is me I should have stayed in bed
Can't get the car my marks ain't been so good, my love life just ain't swingin' like it should
	Problems, problems, problems, they're all on account of my lovin' you like I do
	Problems, problems, problems, they won't be solved until I'm sure of you
	You can solve my problems with a love that's true
Problems, problems, problems all day long, problems, problems, problems all day long

PROUD MARY
Left a good job in the city, working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin', worryin' about the way things might have been
	Big wheel keep on turnin', Proud Mary keep on burnin'
	Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis, pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city, until I hitched a ride on a river boat queen
	Big wheel keep on turnin', Proud Mary keep on burnin'
	Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.
If you come down to the river, bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money, people on the river are happy to give
	Big wheel keep on turnin', Proud Mary keep on burnin'
	Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.

P.S.  I LOVE YOU
What is there to write? What is there to say? Same things happen every day.
Not a thing to write, not a thing to say.So I take my pen in hand, and start the same old way:

Dear, I thought I'd drop a line, the weather's cool, the folks are fine
I'm in bed each night at nine, P.S. I love you.
Yesterday we had some rain, but all in all, I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train? P.S. I love you
	Write to the Browns just as soon as you're able, they came around to call
	I burned a hole in the dining room table, and, let me see, I guess that's all
Nothin' else for me to say, and so I'll close, oh, by the way
Everybody's thinking of you, P.S. I love you

PUFF (THE MAGIC DRAGON)
Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honalee
Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff
And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff.
Oh,  Puff  (chorus is 1st two lines sung twice)
Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail
Noble kings and  princes would bow whene'er they came
Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name
	CHORUS
A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys
Painted wings and giants' rings make way for other toys
One gray night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar
His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane
Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave
So Puff that might dragon sadly slipped into his cave
	CHORUS

PUPPY LOVE
And they called it "puppy love," oh, I guess they'll never know
How a young heart, how it really feels, and why love her so.
And they called it "puppy love," just because we're seventeen
Tell them all, oh, please tell them it isn't fair to take away my only dream
I cry each night, these tears for you, my tears are all in vain
Oh I hope, I hope and I pray that, maybe some day, you'll  be back in my arms once again
Someone help me, help me please, is the answer up above?
How can I, oh, how can I ever tell them, oh, this is not a "puppy love"
Someone help me, help me please, is the answer up above?
How can I, oh, how can I ever tell them, oh, this is not a "puppy love"

THE PUPPY SONG
Dreams are nothing more than wishes, and a wish is just a dream you wish to come true
If only I could have a puppy, I'd call myself so very lucky
Just to have some company to share a cup of tea with me
I'd take my puppy everywhere, la la la la I wouldn't care
But we would stay away from crowds with signs that said no dogs allowed
Oh wee - I know he'd never bite me; wee  - I know he'd never bite me
If only I could have a friend who'd stick with me until the end
And walk along beside the sea and share a bit of moon with me
I'd take my friend most everywhere, la la la la I wouldn't care
But we would stay away from crowds with signs that said no friends allowed
Oh wee - we'd be so happy to be; wee - we'd be so happy to be...together
But dreams are nothing more than wishes, and a wish is just a dream you wish to come true

PUT A LITTLE LOVE IN YOUR HEART
Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand. Put a little love in your heart.
You see it's getting late, oh please don't hesitate.  Put a little love in your heart.
	And the world will be a better place, and the world will be a better place
	For you and me, you just wait and see.
Another day goes by, and still the children cry. Put a little love in your heart.
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow. Put a little love in your heart.
	And the world will be a better place. all the world will be a better place
	For you and me, you just wait and see. Wait and see!
Take a good look around, and if you're looking down, put a little love in your heart.
I hope when you decide, kindness will be your guide. Put a little love in your heart.
	And the world will be a better place and the world will be a better place
	For you and me, just wait and see.
   Put a little love in your heart. (Each and every day)  Put a little love in your heart. (There's no other way)
   Put a little love in your heart.  (It's up to you)  Put a little love in your heart.

PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME, HONEY
Put your arms around me, Honey, hold me tight
Huddle up and cuddle up with all your might
Oh! Oh! Won't you roll those eyes? Eyes that I just idolize

When they look at me, my heart begins to float
Then it starts a rockin' like a motor boat
Oh! Oh! I never knew any girl like you

PUT YOUR HEAD ON MY SHOULDER
Put your head on my shoulder, hold me in your arms, baby
Squeeze me, oh so tight, show me that you love me too
Put your lips next to mine, dear, won't you kiss me once, baby
Just a kiss goodnight, an' maybe, you and I will fall in love
	People say that love's a game, a game you just can't  win
	If there's a way, I'll find it someday, and then this fool will rush in
Put your head on my shoulder, whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear, tell me, tell me that you love me too.
Put your head on my shoulder, whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear, baby, put your head on my shoulder.

PUT ON A HAPPY FACE
Gray skies are gonna clear up, put on a happy face
Brush off the clouds and cheer up, put on a happy face
	Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy, it's not your style
	You'll look so good that you'll be glad you decided to smile
Pick out a pleasant outlook, stick out that noble chin.
Wipe off that full of doubt look, slap on a happy grin
And spread sunshine all over the place, just put on a happy face.

PUTTIN' ON THE RITZ
Have you seen the well-to-do up and down Park Avenue
On that famous thoroughfare with their noses in the air
High Hats and Arrow collars white spats and lots of dollars
Spending every dime for a wonderful time

If you're blue and you don't know where to go to, why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the ritz.
Different types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits,
Puttin' on the ritz.
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (super duper)
Come let's mix where Rockefellers walk with sticks or "umberellas" in their mitts,
Puttin' on the ritz.
If you're blue and you don't know where to go to why don't you go where fashion sits
Puttin' on the ritz  (X3)

PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME, HONEY
Put your arms around me, Honey, hold me tight
Huddle up and cuddle up with all your might
Oh! Oh! Won't you roll those eyes? Eyes that I just idolize

When they look at me, my heart begins to float
Then it starts a rockin' like a motor boat
Oh! Oh! I never knew any girl like you

QUEEN OF THE HOP
Well, you can talk about your Julie and your Peggy Sue
You can keep your Miss Molly and your Mary Lou
When it comes to the chicken or doin' the bop?
I got a girl they call the queen of the hop
	Oh, well, I love my queen. Do you know who I mean?
	Sweet little sixteen, yes, that's my queen
Well, she wears short shorts and a rock 'n roll shoes
You ought to see her dance to the yellow dog blues
She's my sugar time baby, I'm her lollipop,
An' everybody knows I love my queen of the hop
	Oh, well, I love my queen. Do you know who I mean?
	Sweet little sixteen, yes, that's my queen
Oh, well, she tunes in to Bandstand every day
To watch the kids a-dancin' 'cross the USA
She don't care 'bout a thing 'ceptin rock 'n roll
My baby drives me crazy when she does the stroll
	Oh, well, I love my queen. Do you know who I mean?
	Sweet little sixteen, yes, that's my queen

QUE SERA SERA
When I was just a little girl, I asked my mother, "What will I be?
Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?" Here's what she said to me
	Que sera, sera, whatever will be, will be
	The future's not ours to see, que sera, sera, what will be, will be
When I grew up and fell in love, I asked my sweetheart, "What lies ahead?
Will we have rainbows day after day?" Here's what my sweetheart said
	Que sera, sera, whatever will be, will be
	The future's not ours to see, que sera, sera, what will be, will be
Now I have children of my own. They ask their mother, "What will I be?
Will I be handsome? Will I be rich?" I tell them, tenderly
	Que sera, sera, whatever will be, will be
	The future's not ours to see, que sera, sera, what will be, will be
	Que sera sera

QUIET NIGHTS OF QUIET STARS
Quiet nights of quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us.
Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams,
And a window looking on the mountains and the sea, how lovely!
This is where I want to be, here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember.
I, who was lost and lonely, believing life was only
A bitter, tragic joke, have found with you
The meaning of existence, oh, my love..........oh, my love.......oh, my love

RAGS TO RICHES
I know I'd go from rages to riches, if you would only say you care
And though my pocket may be empty, I'd be a millionaire
My clothes may still be torn and tattered, but in my heart I'd be a king
Your love is all that ever mattered, it's everything
	So open your arms and you'll open the door
	To every treasure I'm hoping for
	Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine evermore
Must I forever be a beggar whose golden dreams will not come true
Or will I go from rags to riches, my fate is up to you

RAIN
Listen to the pouring rain, listen to it pour,
And with every drop of rain, you know I love you more
Let it rain all night long, let my love for you grow strong
As long as we're together, who cares about the weather?

Listen to the falling rain, listen to it fall
And with every drop of rain, I can hear you call
Call my name right out loud, I can hear above the clouds
And I'm here among the puddles, you and I together huddled
	Listen to the falling rain, listen to the rain
     It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is snoring
     Went to bed, and he bumped his head, he couldn't get up in the morning
Listen to the falling rain, listen to it fall
And with every drop of rain, I can hear you call
Call my name right out loud, I can hear above the clouds
And I'm here among the puddles, you and I together huddled
	Listen to the falling rain, listen to the rain

RAINDROPS
The raindrops, so many raindrops, it feels like raindrops
Falling from my eye-eyes, falling from my eyes

Since my love has left me, I'm so all alone.
I would bring her back to me, but I don't know where she's gone
I don't know where she's gone
　　　　There must be a cloud in my head, rain keeps falling from my eye-eyes
　　　　Oh no, they can't be teardrops, for a man ain't supposed to cry
So it must be raindrops, so many raindrops, it feels like raindrops
Falling from my eye-eyes, falling from my eyes
　　　　Oh, there must be a cloud in my head, rain keeps falling from my eye-eyes
　　　　Oh no, they can't be teardrops, for a man ain't supposed to cry
So it must be raindrops, so many raindrops, it feels like raindrops
Falling from my eye-eyes, falling from my eyes. It keeps on fallin', fallin' from my eyes

RAINDROPS KEEP FALLIN' ON MY HEAD
Raindrops keep falling on my head, and just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed,
Nothin' seems to fit. Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'. So I just
Did me some talkin' to the sun, and I said I didn't like the way he got things done,
Sleepin' on the job. Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'!
	But there's one thing I know, the blues they send to meet me won't defeat me.
	It won't be long 'til happiness steps up to greet me.
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head, but that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red.
Cryin's not for me 'cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free, nothin's worryin' me.

RAINING IN MY HEART
The sun is out, the sky is blue, there's not a cloud to spoil the view
But it's raining, raining in my heart
The weather man says clear today, he doesn't know you've gone away
And it's raining, raining in my heart.
	Oh,  misery, misery, what's gonna become of me?
I tell my blues they mustn't show, but soon these tears are bound to flow
'Cause it's raining, raining in my heart raining in my heart, raining in my heart

RAIN ON THE ROOF
	You and me and rain on the roof, caught up in a summer shower
	Drying while it soaks the flowers. Maybe we'll be caught for hours, waiting out the sun.
You and me, we're gabbing away, dreamy conversation, sittin' in the hay.
Honey, how long was I laughin' in the rain with you?
'Cause I didn't feel a drop til the thunder brought us to.

You and me underneath a roof of tin.
Pretty comfy feelin', how the rain ain't leakin' in.
We can sit and dry just as long as it can pour.
'Cause the way it makes you look makes me hope it rains some more.
	You and me and rain on the roof, caught up in a summer shower
	Drying while it soaks the flowers. Maybe we'll be caught for hours, waiting out the sun.

RAINY DAYS AND MONDAYS
Talkin' to myself and feelin' old; Sometimes I'd like to quit, nothin' ever seems to fit;
Hangin' a round, nothin' to do but frown. Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.
What I've got they used to call the blues. Nothin' is really wrong, feelin' like I don't belong,
Walkin' around, some kind of lonely clown. Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.
	Funny but it seems I always wind up here with you. Nice to know somebody loves  me.
	Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do. Run and find the one who loves me
What I feel has come and gone before.  No need to talk it out, we know what it's all about;
Hangin' around, nothin' to do but frown. Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.
	Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do. Run and find the one who loves  me
What I feel has come and gone before.  No need to talk it out, we know what it's all about;
Hangin' around, nothin' to do but frown. Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.
Hangin' around, nothin' to do but frown. Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.

RAKE AND RAMBLIN' BOY
	Oh, I'm a rake and a ramblin' boy. There's many a city, Lord, I did enjoy,
	And now I've married me a pretty little wife, and I love her dearer than I love my life.
Oh, she was pretty, both sweet and fair, caused me to rob that broad highway
Oh, yes, I robbed it, I do declare, and I got myself thousand there.
	Oh, I'm a rake and a ramblin' boy. There's many a city, Lord, I did enjoy,
	And now I've married me a pretty little wife, and I love her dearer than I love my life.
Now when I die don't bury me at all, just place my bones, Lord, in alcohol
And at my feet, place a pretty little dove to show the world that I died for love.
	Oh, I'm a rake and a ramblin' boy. There's many a city, Lord, I did enjoy,
	And now I've married me a pretty little wife, and I love her dearer than I love my life.
            And I love her dearer than I love my life, and I love her dearer than I love my life.

RAMBLIN' ROSE
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose, why you ramble, no one knows.
Wild and wind-blown, that's how you've grown, who can cling to a Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, ramble on. When your ramblin' days are gone.
Who will love you, with a love true, when your ramblin' days are gone?
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose, why I want you, heaven knows.
Though I love you, with a love true, who can cling to a Ramblin' Rose?
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose, why I want you, heaven knows.
Though I love you, with a love true, who can cling to a Ramblin' Rose?

RAMONA
I wander out yonder o'er the hills, where the mountains high, seem to kiss the sky
Someone's up yonder o'er the hills, waiting patiently, waiting just for me

Ramona, I hear the mission bells above.
Ramona, they're ringing out our song of love
I press you, caress you, and bless the day you taught me to care
To always remember the rambling rose you wear in your hair

Ramona, when day is done you'll hear my call.
Ramona, we'll meet beside the waterfall
I dread the dawn, when I awake to find you gone
Ramona, I need you, my own

REACHING FOR SOMEONE AND NOT FINDING ANYONE THERE
I'm just a bubble of trouble and care
Very fond of petting, but I'm getting nowhere
Reaching for someone and not finding anyone there

No sweet romancer to answer my prayer
Always building castles that nobody will share
Reaching for someone and not finding anyone there  (not finding anyone the-ere)
	Is there a June honeymoon, is there a tune lover's croon
	Is there a day coming soon, when I'll find someone somewhere
Who wouldn't worry and who wouldn't swear
Heaven is a Hades when you're up in the air
Reaching for someone and not finding anyone there

REACH OUT AND TOUCH (SOMEBODY'S HAND)
	Reach out and touch somebody's hand, make this world a better place, if you can
	Reach out and touch somebody's hand, make this world a better place, if you can
Take a little time out of your busy day to give encouragement to someone who's lost the way
Or would I be talking to stone, if I asked you to share a problem that's not your own
We can change things, if we start giving, why don't you
	Reach out and touch somebody's hand, .......
If you see an old friend on the street, and he's down, remember his shoes could fit your feet
Try a little kindness, you'll see, it's something that comes very naturally
We can change things, if we start giving, why don't you
	Reach out and touch somebody's hand, ....... (X2)

REAL LIVE GIRL
Pardon me, miss, but I've never done this with a real live girl
What could be harmful in holding an armful of real live girl?
Pardon me if your affectionate squeeze fogs up my goggles, and buckles my knees
I'm simply drowned in the sight and the sound and the scent and the feel of a real live girl

Nothing can beat getting swept off your feet by a real live girl
Dreams in your bunk don't compare with a hunk of a real live girl
Girls were too girlish was once my belief, what a reversal, and what a relief
I'll take the flowering hat and the towering heel and the squeal of a real live girl
	I've seen photographs and facsimiles that have set my heart off in a whirl
But I'd overlook everyone in the book for a real live girl
Take your Venetian, or Roman, or Grecian ideal live girl
Go be a holdout for Helen of Troy, I am a healthy American boy
And I'd rather gape at the dear little shape of the stern and the keel
Of a real live, full-time vocational, all operational girl

REASON TO BELIEVE
If I listened long enough to you, I'd find a way to believe that it's all true.
	Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried,
	Still I'd look to find a reason to believe.
	Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else.
	Someone like you makes it easy to give, never thinkin' of myself.
If I gave you time to change my mind,  I'd find a way to leave the past behind.
	Knowing....

RED RIVER VALLEY
From this valley they say you are going. We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For they say you are taking the sunshine that has brightened our pathways awhile
Come and sit by my side, if you love me. Do not hasten to bid me adieu
Just remember the Red River Valley and the cowboy who loved you so true.
I've been thinking a long time, my darling, of the sweet words you never would say
Now, alas, must my fond hopes all vanish, for they say you are going away.

RED ROSES FOR A BLUE LADY
I want some red roses for a blue lady
Mr. Florist, take my order, please.
We had a silly quarrel the other day
I hope these pretty flowers chase her blues away.
Wrap up some red roses for a blue lady,
Send them to the sweetest gal in town.
And, if they do the trick, I'll hurry back to pick
Your best white orchids for her wedding gown.

RED RUBBER BALL
I should have known you'd bid me farewell
There's a lesson to be learned from this, and I learned it very well
Now I know you're not the only starfish in the sea
If I never hear your name again, it's all the same to me
	And I think it's gonna be alright, yeah, the worst is over now
	The mornin' sun is shinin' like a red rubber ball
You never care for secrets I confide,
For you I'm just an ornament, somethin' for your pride
Always runnin', never carin', that's the life you live
And stolen minutes of your time were all you had to give
	And I think it's gonna be alright, yeah, the worst is over now
	The mornin' sun is shinin' like a red rubber ball
The story's in the past with nothin' to recall
I've got my life to live and I don't need you at all
The roller-coaster ride we took is nearly at an end
I bought my ticket with my tears, that's all I'm gonna spend
	And I think it's gonna be alright, yeah, the worst is over now
	The mornin' sun is shinin' like a red rubber ball

RED SAILS IN THE SUNSET
Red sails in the sunset, way out on the sea
Oh, carry my loved one home safely to me
She sailed at the dawning, all day I've been blue
Red sails in the sunset, I'm trusting in you
	Swift wings you must borrow
	Make straight for the shore
	We marry tomorrow
	And she goes sailing no more
Red sails in the sunset, way out on the sea
Oh, carry my loved one home safely to me

RELEASE ME
Please release me, let me go, for I don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin, release me, and let me love again,
I have found a new love, dear, and I will always want her near,
Her lips are warm, while yours are cold, release me, my darling, let me go.
	Please release me, let me go, for I don't love you anymore
	To waste our lives would be a sin, release me, and let me love again,
Please release me can't you see, you'd be a fool to cling to me,
To live a lie would bring us pain, so release me, and let me love again. Let me go, let me go.

REMEMBER ME
Do you remember one September afternoon, I stood with you and listened to a wedding tune,
And didn't I go with you on your honeymoon? Remember me?

Do you recall a cottage small upon a hill, where every day I had to pay another bill?
And if I'm not mistaken, dear, I pay them still. Remember me?
	I can see that little angel on your knee. Can't you see,  he kinda sorta looks like me
For I'm the boy whose only joy is loving you who worries till he hurries home when day is through
And I'm the guy you give you goodnight kisses to, remember me?

REMEMBER WHEN
Remember when I first met you, my lips were so afraid to say, "I love you."
Remember when, to my surprise, the heaven in my heart leaped into your eyes
	Remember how much I cried. It was dumb to think you were mine
	Darling, down deep inside, I still feel that feeling divine
I loved you then, and I still do. I can't remember when I didn't love you
	Remember how much I cried. It was dumb to think you were mine
	Darling, down deep inside, I still feel that feeling divine
I loved you then, and I still do. I can't remember when I didn't love you

REMINISCING
Friday night it was late I was walking you home
We got down to the gate and I was dreaming of the night. Would it turn out right?
How to tell you, girl, I wanna build my world around you. Tell you that it's true.
             I wanna make you understand, I'm talking about a lifetime plan
            That's the way it began we were hand in hand,
Glenn Miller's band was better than before, we yelled and screamed for more
And the Porter tune ("Night and Day") made us dance across the room. It ended all too soon
        And on the way back home, I promised you'd never be alone
	Hurry don't be late, I can hardly wait, I said to myself,  "When we're old,
	We'll go dancing in the dark, walking through the park, and remi-niscing
Friday night it was late I was walking you home
We got down to the gate and I was dreaming of the night. Would it turn out right?
Now as the years roll on, each time we hear our favorite song, the memories come along
       Oh the times we're missing, spending the hours remi-niscing
	Hurry don't be late, I can hardly wait, I said to myself,  "When we're old,
	We'll go dancing in the dark, walking through the park, and reminiscing
	We'll go dancing in the dark, walking through the park, and reminiscing

RETURN TO SENDER
I gave a letter to the postman, he put it his sack
Bright 'n early next morning, he brought my letter back
She wrote upon it: Return to sender, address unknown, no such number, no such zone
We had a quarrel, a lover's spat. I write I'm sorry but my letter keeps coming back
So then I dropped it in the mailbox and sent it special D
Bright 'n early next morning it came right back to me
She wrote upon it: Return to sender, address unknown, no such number, no such zone
	This time I'm gonna take it myself and put it right in her hand
	And if it comes back the very next day then I'll understand
The writing on it: Return to sender, address unknown, no such number, no such zone

RHINESTONE COWBOY
I've been walkin' these streets so long,  singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
   There's been a load of compromisin' on the road to my horizon
   But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
	Like a rhinestone cowboy, riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
	Like a rhinestone cowboy, getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
	And offers comin' over the phone
Well, I really don't mind the rain,  and a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do, with a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
   There'll be a load of compromisin' on the road to my horizon
   But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
	Like a rhinestone cowboy, riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
	Like a rhinestone cowboy, getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
	And offers comin' over the phone

RHODE ISLAND IS FAMOUS FOR YOU
Copper comes from Arizona,  peaches come from Georgia
And lobsters come from Maine
The wheat fields are the sweet fields of Nebraska
And Kansas gets bonanzas from the grain

Old whiskey comes from old Kentucky, ain't the country lucky
New Jersey gives us glue
And you, you come from Rhode Island
And little old Rhode Island is famous for you

Cotton comes from Lousiana, gophers from Mon-tana
And spuds from Idaho
They plow land in the cow land of Missoura
Where most beef meant for roast beef seems to grow
Grand canyons come from Colorada, gold comes from Nevada
Di-vorces also do
And you, you come from Rhode Island
And little old Rhode Island is famous for you

Pencils come from Pennsylvania, vests from Vest Virginia
And Tents from Tentesee
They know mink where they grow mink in Wyomink
A camp chair in New Hampchair that's for me

And minnows come from Minnesota, coats come from Dakota
But why should you be blue?
For you, you come from Rhode Island
Don't let them ride Rhode Island, it's famous for you,
You,  you come from Rhode Island, and little ol' Rhode Island is famous for you.

RHYTHM OF THE RAIN
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain, telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain, and let me be alone again

The only girl I care about has gone away, looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day, along with her she took my heart
	Rain please tell me now does that seem fair
	For her to steal my heart away when she don't care
	I can't love another when my hearts somewhere far away
Repeat 2nd verse

RICH GIRL
	You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far, 'cause you know it don't matter anyway
	You can rely on the old man's money, you can rely on the old man's money
	It's a bitch, girl, but it's gone too far, 'cause you know it don't matter anyway
	Say money, money won't get you too far, get you too far
Don't you know, don't you know that it's wrong to take what is given you
So far gone, on your own, you can get along if you try to be strong
But you'll never be strong 'cause
	You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far, 'cause you know it don't matter anyway
	You can rely on the old man's money, you can rely on the old man's money
	It's a bitch, girl, and it's gone too far, 'cause you know it don't matter anyway
	Say money, money won't get you too far, get you too far
High and dry, out of the rain, it's so easy to hurt others when you can't feel pain
And don't you know that a love can't grow
'Cause there's too much to give, 'cause you'd rather live for the thrill of it all, oh
	You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far, 'cause you know it don't matter anyway
	You can rely on the old man's money, you can rely on the old man's money
	It's a bitch, girl, and it's gone too far, 'cause you know it don't matter anyway
	Say money, money won't get you too far, say money, money won't get you too far
	Say money, money won't get you too far, get you too far
	You can rely on the old man's money, you can rely on the old man's money
	It's a bitch, girl, and it's gone too far, 'cause you know it don't matter anyway

(GHOST) RIDERS IN THE SKY
An old cowpoke went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A-plowin' through the ragged skies, and up a cloudy draw
	Yippie-yi yaaay, yippie-yi ooohh, a ghost herd in the sky
Their brands were still on fire, and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny, and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard, and he heard their mournful cry
	Yippie-yi yaaay, yippie-yi ooohh, ghost riders in the sky
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd, but they ain't caught 'em yet
 'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cries
	Yippie-yi yaaay, yippie-yi ooohh, ghost riders in the sky
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
'If you wanna save your soul from hell, a-ridin' on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride,
Trying to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies
	Yippie-yi ooohh, yippie-yi yaaay, ghost riders in the sky
	Ghost riders in the sky, ghost riders in the sky

RING OF FIRE
Love is a burning thing, and it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire, I fell into a ring of fire
	I fell into a burning ring of fire,
	I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher
	And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire, the ring of fire
The taste of love is sweet, when hearts like ours meet
I fell  for you like a child, oh, but the fire went wild
	I fell into a burning ring of fire,
	I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher
	And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire, the ring of fire

ROCK AND ROLL IS HERE TO STAY
	Rock, rock, rock, oh, baby, rock, rock, rock, oh, baby
	Rock, rock, rock, oh, baby, rock, rock, rock, oh, baby
Rock and roll is here to stay, it will never die
It was meant to be that way, though I don't know why
I don't care what people say, rock and roll is here to stay
	(We don't care what people say, rock and roll is here to stay)
Rock and roll will always be, I dig it to the end
It'll go down in history, just you watch, my friend
Rock and roll will always be, it'll go down in history
	(Rock and roll will always be, it'll go down in history)
	(Everybody rock, everybody rock,)
	(Everybody rock, everybody rock, rock, roll, everybody rock)
Rock and roll is here to stay, it will never die
It was meant to be that way, though I don't know why
I don't care what people say, rock and roll is here to stay

Rock and roll will always be, I dig it to the end
It'll go down in history, just you watch, my friend
Rock and roll will always be, it'll go down in history

If you don't like rock and roll, think what you've been missin'
But, if you like to bop and stroll,
Let's  all start to have a ball, everybody rock and roll
	Rock, rock, rock, oh, baby, rock, rock, rock, oh, baby
	Rock, rock, rock, oh, baby, rock, rock, rock, oh, baby ROCK!

ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC
	Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music, any old way you choose it
	It's got a back beat, you can't lose it, any old time you use it
	It's gotta be rock and roll music, if you wanna dance with me, if you wanna dance with me
I have no kick against modern jazz, unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody, until they sound just like a symphony
	That's why I go for that rock and roll music  (chorus)
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks, so she can hear my man a-wail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band, man, they were blowin' like a hurrican'
	That's why I go for that rock and roll music  (chorus)
Way down South they gave a jubilee, the jokey folks, they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a wooden cup, the folks dancin' got all shook up
	And started playin' that rock and roll music (chorus)
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango, and, in the mood, they take a mambo
It's way too early for the congo, so keep a rockin' that piano
	So I can hear some of that rock and roll music (chorus)

ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK
	One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock rock
	Five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock rock
	Nine, ten, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock rock
	We're gonna rock around the clock tonight.
Put your glad rags on and join me hon', we'll have some fun when the clock strikes one,
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock 'til broad daylight
We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight

When it's eight, nine, ten, eleven too, I'll be goin' strong and so will you.....we're gonna rock...
When the clock strikes 12 we'll cool off then, start a rockin' 'round the clock again.....we're gonna

ROCKIN' AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE
Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop.
Rockin' around the Christmas tree, let the Christmas spirit ring.
Later we'll have some punkin pie and we'll do some caroling.
	You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
	Voices singing "Let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly."
Rockin' around the Christmas tree have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily in the new old fashioned way.

ROCKING CHAIR
Old rocking chair's got me, my cane by my side,
Fetch me that gin, son, 'fore I tan your hide.
Can't get from this cabin, goin' nowhere
Just set me here grabbin' at the flies 'round this rocking chair

My dear old aunt Harriet, in Heaven she be,
Send me sweet chariot, for the end of the troubles I see
Old rocking chair gets it, judgment day is here
Chained to my rocking chair.

ROCKIN' ROBIN
Tweedly-deedly-dee, Tweedly-deedly-dee, Tweedly-deedly-dee, Tweedly-deedly-dee
Tweedly-deedly-dee, Tweedly-deedly-dee, tweet..... tweet.....tweet  tweet!

He rocks in the treetop all the day long, hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' his song
All the little birds on Jaybird Street, love to hear the robin go "Tweet, tweet, tweet."
Rockin' Robin...Rockin' Robin...Blow, Rockin' Robin 'cause we're really gonna rock tonight

Every little swallow, every chickadee, every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow, flap their wings, singin' "Go, bird, go."
Rockin' Robin...Rockin' Robin...Blow, Rockin' Robin 'cause we're really gonna rock tonight

A pretty little raven at the bird bandstand, taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
They started goin' steady, and bless my soul, he out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole.
Repeat 1st verse.  (He rocks in the treetop....)

ROCK THE BOAT
	So I'd like to know where, you got the notion. Said I'd like to know where, you got the notion
	To rock the boat, don't rock the boat baby, rock the boat, don't tip the boat over
	Rock the boat, don't rock the boat baby....Rock the boat
Ever since our voyage of love began
Your touch has thrilled me like the rush of the wind
And your arms have held me safe from a rolling sea
There's always been a quiet place to harbor you and me
Our love is like a ship on the ocean, we've been sailing with a cargo full of, love and devotion
	Chorus
Up to now we sailed through every storm
And I've always had your tender lips to keep me warm
Oh I need to have the strength that flows from you
Don't let me drift away my dear, when love can see me through
Our love is like a ship on the ocean, we've been sailing with a cargo full of, love and devotion
	Chorus

ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGH
He was born in the summer of his 27th year, coming home to a place he'd never been before.
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again,
You might say he found a key for every door.
When he first came to the mountains, his life was far away on the road and hanging by a song.
But the string's already broken, and he doesn't really care,
It keeps changing fast, and it don't last for long.
	And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
	The shadows from the starlight are softer than a lullaby.
	Rocky Mountain high, Colorado. Rocky Mountain high.
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below,
He saw everything as far as you can see.
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun,
And he lost a friend, but kept the memory.
Now he walks in quiet solitude, the forest and the streams, seeking grace in every step he takes.
His sight is turned inside himself, to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake.
	And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
	You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply.
	Rocky Mountain high, Colorado. Rocky Mountain high.
Now his life is full of wonder, but his heart still knows some fear,
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend.
Why they try to tear the mountains down, to bring in a couple more,
More people, more scars upon the land.
	And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
	I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly,
	Rocky Mountain high, the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
	Friends around the campfire and everybody's high
	Rocky Mountain high, Colorado. Rocky Mountain high.
	Rocky Mountain high.

ROCKY RACOON
Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye, Rocky didn't like that, he said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town, and booked himself a room in the local saloon

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room, only to find Gideon's bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun, to shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams, by stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was McGill, and she called herself Lil, but everyone knew her as Nancy

Now she and her man who called himself Dan were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin, he said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown!"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot, and Rocky collapsed in the corner, ah

Do, do, do..........

Now the doctor came in, and stinking of gin, he proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match, and Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch,
And I'll be better, I'll be better, doc, as soon as I am able."

And now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room, only to find Gideon's bible
But Gideon checked out, he left in no doubt to help with good Rocky's revival, ah
Oh yeah, yeah

Do, do, do..........

THE ROSE
Some say love, it is a river that drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower, and you, its only seed
	It's the heart, afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance
	It's the dream, afraid of waking that never takes the chance
	It's the one who won't be taken, who cannot seem to give
	And the soul, afraid of dying that never learns to live
When the night has been too lonely, and the road has been too long
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter, far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love, in the spring Becomes the rose

LOOKING AT THE WORLD THROUGH ROSE COLORED GLASSES
	     I said goodbye to Mr. Sorrow, how do you do, Mr. Joy?
	     Don't need to worry 'bout tomorrow
	     Look at me, and you'll see a soul who's happy as can be, because...
I'm lookin' at the world through rose colored glasses, everything is rosy now.
Lookin' at the world and everything that passes, seems of rosy hue somehow

Why do I feel so spry? don't wink your eye,
Needn't guess I'll confess, certain someone just said yes.
In a bungalow all covered with roses, I will settle down I vow,
Because I'm lookin' at the world through rose colored glasses, and everything is rosy now.

ROSES ARE RED
	Roses are red, my love... Doo doo doo doooo...
A long, long time ago, on graduation day. You handed me your book... I signed this way:
"Roses are red, my love, violets are blue. Sugar is sweet, my love, but not as sweet as you. "

We dated through high school, and when the big day came, I wrote into your book, next to my name:
"Roses are red, my love, violets are blue. Sugar is sweet, my love, but not as sweet as you. "

Then I went far away, and you found someone new. I read your letter dear, and I wrote back to you:
"Roses are red, my love, violets are blue. Sugar is sweet, my love, good luck, may God bless you. "

Is that your little girl? She looks a lot like you. Someday some boy will write In her book, too:
"Roses are red, my love, violets are blue. Sugar is sweet, my love, but not as sweet as you. "

ROUND AND ROUND
Find a wheel and it goes round, round, round, as it skims along with a happy sound
As it goes along the ground, ground, ground, till it leads you to the one you love

Then your love will hold you round, round, round, in your heart's a song with a brand new sound
And your head goes spinning round, round, round, 'cause you've found what you've been dreamin' of
	In the night you see the oval moon, going round and round in tune
	And the ball of sun in the day makes a girl and boy wanna say
Find a ring and put it round, round, round, and with ties so strong that two hearts are bound
Put it on the one you've found, found, found, for you know that this is really love

RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it, you would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names,
They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games.
	Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say:
	"Rudolph, with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee:
"Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer, you'll go down in history."

RUNAROUND SUE
Here's my story, sad but true, it's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love then ran around with every single guy in town

Ah, I should have known it from the very start, this girl will leave me with a broken heart
Now listen people what I'm telling you, keep away from Runaround Sue
I miss her lips and the smile on her face, the touch of her hair and this girl's warm embrace
So if you don't want to cry like I do, keep away from Runaround Sue
	Ah, she likes to travel around, she'll love you and she'll put you down
	Now people let me put you wise, Sue goes out with other guys
Here's the moral of the story from the guy who knows, I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll say keep away from Runaround Sue

RUNAWAY
As I walk along I wonder a-what went wrong with our love, a love that was so strong
And as I still walk on, I think of the things we've done together, a-while our hearts were young

I'm a-walkin' in the rain, tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
Wishin' you were here by me to end this misery
And I wonder, I wa-wa-wa-wa-wonder why, ah-why-why-why-why-why she ran away
And I wonder where she will stay,  my little runaway, run-run-run-run-runaway

RUN FOR YOUR LIFE
Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man
You'd better keep your head, little girl, or you won't know where I am
You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl, hide your head in the sand, little girl,
Catch you with another man, that's the end-a little girl!
Well you know that I'm a wicked guy, and I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life tryin' just to make you toe the line
You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl, hide your head in the sand, little girl,
Catch you with another man, that's the end-a little girl

RUNNING SCARED
Just runnin' scared each place we go, so afraid that he might show
Yeah, runnin' scared, what would I do if he came back and wanted you?

Just runnin' scared, feelin low, runnin' scared, you love him so
Just runnin' scared, afraid to lose, if he came back, which one would you choose?

Then all at once he was standing there, so sure of himself, his head in the air
My heart was breaking, which one would it be?
You turned around and walked away with me.

SAD SONGS SAY SO MUCH
Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironin' out the rough spots is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
`Cause from the lips of some old singer, we can share the troubles we already know
	Turn them on, turn them on, turn on those sad songs
	When all hope is gone, why don't you tune in and turn them on
They reach into your room, oh, just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone, sad songs say so much

If someone else is suffering enough, oh, to write it down
When every single word makes sense, then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad, and suffer just enough to sing the blues
	So turn them on, turn them on, turn on those sad songs
	When all hope is gone, why don't you tune in and turn them on
	They reach into your room, oh, just feel their gentle touch
	When all hope is gone, you know, sad songs say so much
Sad songs, they say, sad songs, they say, sad songs, they say, sad songs, they say so much
	So turn them on, turn them on, turn on those sad songs
	When all hope is gone, why don't you tune in and turn them on
They reach into your room, oh, just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone, you know, sad songs say so much
When every little bit of hope is gone, sad songs say so much

SAME AULD LANG SYNE
Met my old lover in the grocery store. The snow was falling Christmas Eve
I stood behind her in the frozen foods, and I touched her on the sleeve
     She didn't recognize the face at first, but then her eyes flew open wide
     She went to hug me and she spilled her purse, and we laughed until we cried
We took her groceries to the check-out stand. The food was totaled up and bagged
We stood there, lost in our embarrassment, as the conversation lagged
     We went to have ourselves a drink or two, but couldn't find an open bar
     We bought a six-pack at the liquor store, and we drank it in her car
We drank a toast to innocence, we drank a toast to now
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness, but neither one knew how
     She said she's married her an architect, who kept her warm and safe and dry
     She would have liked to say she loved the man, but she didn't like to lie
I said the years had been a friend to her, and that her eyes were still as blue
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I saw doubt or gratitude
     She said she saw me in the record stores, and that I must be doing well
     I said the audience was heavenly, but the traveling was Hell
We drank a toast to innocence, we drank a toast to now
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness, but neither one knew how
	     We drank a toast to innocence, we drank a toast to time
	     Reliving, in our eloquence, another "Auld Lang Syne"
The beer was empty, and our tongues were tired, and running out of things to say
She gave a kiss to me as I got out, and I watched her drive away
     Just for a moment I was back at school, and felt that old familiar pain
     And, as I turned to make my way back home, the snow turned into rain

SANDY
Sandy made me promise not to tell, not a soul must know how well we love
Stars and moons and galaxies can't compare with how I see her eyes
	She loves to live, and lives to love,  happily
	I give her love, and take her love gratefully, oh, gratefully
Stars and moons and galaxies can't compare with how I see her eyes, oh
	Interlude
Sandy made me promise not to tell, not a soul must know how well we love
Sandy, Sandy, Sandy, Sandy, Sandy

SAN FRANCISCO
If you're going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San Francisco,  you're gonna meet some gentle people there
For those who come to San Francisco,  summertime will be a love-in there
In the streets of San Francisco, gentle people with flowers in their hair
All across the nation, such a strange vibration, people in motion
There's a whole generation with a new explanation, people in motion, people in motion
For those who come to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you come to San Francisco, summertime will be a love-in there

SAN FRANCISCO BAY BLUES
I got the blues from my baby down by the San Francisco Bay,
Ocean liner took her so far away.
I didn't mean to treat her so bad, she was the best gal I ever had,
She said goodbye, gonna make me cry, guess I'm gonna lay down my head and die.

I ain't got a nickel and I ain't got a lousy dime.
If she don't come back, I think I"m gonna lose my mind.
If she ever comes back to stay, it's going to be another brand new day,
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay.
	Sittin' down looking through my back door, wonderin' which way to go,
   	The woman I'm so crazy about, she don't love me any more.
	Think I'll take a freight train, cause I'm feelin' blue,
	Ride all the way to the end of the line, thinkin' only of you.
Meanwhile, in another city, just about to go insane,
Well I thought I heard my baby, Lord, the way she used to call my name.
If she ever comes back to stay, it's going to be another brand new day,
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay,
If she ever comes back to stay, it's going to be another brand new day,
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay, San Francisco Bay.

SANTA CATALINA (26 MILES)
	Twenty- six miles a-cross the sea, Santa Cata-lina is a-waitin' for me
	Santa Cata-lina, the island of ro-mance, ro-mance, ro-mance, ro-mance
Water all around it everywhere, tropical trees and the salty air
But for me the thing that's a-waitin' there....romance

It seems so distant, twenty-six miles away, restin' in the water serene
I'd work for anyone, even the Navy who would float me to my island dream

Twenty- six miles, so near yet far, I'd swim with just some water-wings and my guitar
I could leave the wings but I'll need the guitar for romance, romance, romance, romance
	chorus
A tropical heaven out in the ocean, covered with trees and girls
If I have to swim, I'll do it forever, till I'm gazin' on those island pearls

Forty kilometers in a leaky old boat, any old thing that'll stay afloat
When we arrive we'll all promote romance, romance, romance, romance
	chorus

SANTA CLAUS BLUES
Now, listen kids, and listen good, if we don't eat the things we should
No 'lectric train or dog we'll choose,
We'll wake up Christmas morning with the Santa Claus Blues
Let's eat the good things on our plate,  'cause if we don't cooperate,
The twenty-fifth we've gotta lose,
We'll wake up Christmas morning with the Santa Claus Blues
	Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells are comin' right our way
	But don't forget we've gotta get the Santa Claus okay
Now I've been through it, so I know, and if you want your tree to glow
Be sure to mind your p's and q's, or wake up Christmas morning with the Santa Claus Blues

SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN
You better watch out, you better not cry, better not pout, I'm telling you why:
Santa Claus is coming to town.
He's making a list and checking it twice, gonna find out who's naughty and nice,
Santa Claus is coming to town.
He sees you when you're sleeping, he knows when you're awake,
He knows if you're been bad or good, so be good for goodness sake.
You better watch out, you better not cry, better not pout, I'm telling you why:
Santa Claus is coming to town.

SANTA LUCIA
Sul mare luccica l'astro d'argento
Placida é l'onda prospero il vento
Sul mare luccica l'astro d'argento
Placida é l'onda prospero il vento

Venite all'agile barchetta mia
Santa lucia, Santa lucia
Venite all'agile barchetta mia
Santa lucia, Santa lucia

Soft winds caress the sea, breezes so tender,
Make every dancing wave gladly surrender!
Days here are heavenly, nights are pure ecstasy,
Santa lucia, Santa lucia!
Venite all'agile barchetta mia
Santa lucia, Santa lucia

SATIN DOLL
Cigarette holder, which wigs me, over her shoulder, she digs me. Out cattin', that Satin Doll.
Baby, shall we go out skippin'? Careful, amigo, you're flippin'. Speaks Latin, that Satin Doll.
She's nobody's fool, so I'm playin' it cool as can be
I'll give it a whirl, but I ain't for no girl catchin' me....Switcherooney!
Telephone numbers, well you know, doin' my rhumbas with uno, And that'n, my Satin Doll.

SATURDAY NIGHT IS THE LONELIEST NIGHT OF THE WEEK
Saturday night is the loneliest night of the week
'Cause that's the night that my sweetie and I used to dance cheek to cheek
I don't mind Sunday night at all 'cause that's the night friends come to call
And Monday to Friday goes fast, and an-other week is past

But Saturday night is the loneliest night of the week
I sing the song that I sang for the memories I usually seek
Until I hear you at the door, until you're in my arms once more
Saturday night is the loneliest night of the week  (repeat last two lines)

SAVE THE LAST DANCE FOR ME
You can dance every dance with the guy who gave you the eye; let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the man who held your hand 'neath the pale moonlight
	But don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be
	So darlin' save the last dance for me.
Oh, I know  that  the music is fine,  like  sparkling wine; go and have your fun
Laugh  and  sing, but while we're  apart don't give your heart to anyone
	But don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be
	So darlin' save the last dance for me.
Baby, don't you know I love you so? Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go.  I love you, oh, so much.

You can dance, go and carry on till the night is gone and it's time to go
If he asks if you're all alone, ccan he take you home, you must tell him no.
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be
So, darlin', save the last dance for me. So, darlin', save the last dance for me.
So, darlin', save the last dance for me.

SAY, HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY SWEET GYPSY ROSE
	We were very happy, well, at least I thought we were
	Can't somebody tell me what's got into her?
	A house, a home, a family, and a man who loves her so
	Who'd believe she'd leave us, to join a burlesque show?
Say, has anybody seen my Sweet Gypsy Rose?
Here's her picture when she was my Sweet Mary Jo
Now she's got rings on her fingers, and bells on her toes.
Say, has anybody seen my Sweet gypsy Rose?

Oh, I go when my Jo's been dancin' here in New Orleans
In this smoke-filled honky-tonk they call the land of dreams
Whoa, here she comes a-struttin' in her birthday clothes
Say has anybody seen my Sweet gypsy Rose?
	Whoa, baby, baby, Won'tcha come home
	Say, we all miss ya, and every night we kiss your picture
Whoa, Rose, one night the lights go dim, and the crowd goes home
That's the day you wake up, and you find you're all alone
So, let's say goodbye to Gypsy, Hello, Mary Jo
Say has anybody seen my Sweet gypsy Rose?
     So, take those rings off your fingers, and bells off your toes
     Say has anybody seen my, now you know just what I mean by
     Has anybody seen my Sweet Gypsy Rose?

SAY IT ISN'T SO
Say it isn't so, say it isn't so, everyone is saying you don't love me, say it isn't so
Everywhere I go, everyone I know, whispers that you're growing tired of me, say it isn't so
People say that you found somebody new, and it won't be long before you leave me, say it isn't true
Say that everything is still OK, that's all I want to know, and what they're saying,  say it isn't so!
SCARLET RIBBONS
I peeked in to say goodnight, and I heard my child in prayer
"And, for me, some scarlet ribbons, scarlet ribbons for my hair."

All the stores were closed and shuttered, all the streets were dark and bare
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, not one ribbon for her hair.
	Through the night my heart was aching, just before the dawn was breaking.
I peeked in and, on her bed, in gay profusion, lying there
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons, scarlet ribbons for her hair
	If I live to be a hundred, I will never know from where
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, scarlet ribbons for her hair.

SCOTCH AND SODA
Scotch  and  soda, mud in your eye,  baby do I feel  high, oh me oh my, do I feel high
Dry martini, jigger of gin, oh, what a spell you've got me in, oh my, do I feel high
People won't believe me, they'll think that I'm just braggin'
But I could feel the way I do and still be on the wagon.

All I need is one of your smiles, sunshine of your eyes, oh me, oh my,
Do I feel higher than a kite can fly! Give me lovin', baby I feel high.

SEA CRUISE
Old man rhythm is in my shoes, it's no use sittin' and singin' the blues,
So be my guest, you got nothin' to lose, won't you let me take you on a sea cruise?
Ooowee, ooowee baby, ooowee, ooowee baby,
Ooowee, ooowee baby! won't you let me take you on a sea cruise?
	I feel like jumpin' baby won't you join me please
	I don't like beggin' but now I'm on bended knees
I got to get to rockin', get my hat off the rack,
I got to boogie-woogie like a knife in the back,
So be my guest, you've got nothin' to lose, won't you let me take you on a sea cruise?
Ooowee, ooowee baby, ooowee, ooowee baby,
Ooowee, ooowee baby! won't you let me take you on a sea cruise?
	I feel like jumpin' baby won't you join me please
	I don't like beggin' but now I'm on bended knees
I got to get to movin' baby, I ain't lyin',
My heart is beating rhythm and it's right on time.
So be my guest, you've got nothin' to lose, won't you let me take you on a sea cruise?
Ooowee, ooowee baby, ooowee, ooowee mama,
Ooowee, ooowee baby! won't you let me take you on a sea cruise?

SEALED WITH A KISS
'Tho we gotta say good-bye for the summer, darling, I promise you this:
I'll send you all my love every day in the letter, sealed with a kiss.
Guess it's gonna be a cold, lonely summer, but I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my dreams every day in a letter, sealed with a kiss.
	I'll see you in the sunlight, I'll hear your voice everywhere.
	I'll run to tenderly hold you, but darling, you won't be there.
I don't wanna say good-bye for the summer, knowing the live we'll miss
Oh, let us make a pledge to meet in September, and seal it with a kiss.

SEARCHIN'
(Gonna find her) (X4)
Yeah, I've been searchin'  searchin' Oh, yeah, searchin' every which a-way
Oh, yeah, searchin', I'm searchin', searchin' every which a-way, yeah, yeah
But I'm like that Northwest Mountie-You know I'll bring her in someday
Well now, if I have to swim a river, you know I will,
And if I have to climb a mountain, you know I will.
And if she's a-hiding up on a-Blueberry Hill,
Am I gonna find her, child, you know I will.
	'Cause I've been searchin', oh yeah, searching,
	My goodness, searchin' every which a-way, yeah, yeah
	But I'm like that Northwest Mountie-You know I'll bring her in some day.
Well, Sherlock Holmes, Sam Spade got nothing, child, on me.
Sergeant Friday, Charlie Chan, and Boston Blackie.
No matter where she's hiding, she's gonna hear me a-comin'
I'm gonna walk right down that street, like Bulldog Drummond
	'Cause I've been searchin', Oh Lord, now, searchin', mm child,
	Searchin' every which a-way, yeah, yeah
	But I'm like that Northwest Mountie-You know I'll bring her in some day. (Gonna find her)

SECOND HAND ROSE
Father had a business, strictly second hand, everything from toothpicks to a baby grand
Stuff in our apartment came from father's store, even clothes I'm wearing, someone wore before
It's no wonder that I feel abused, I never get a thing that ain't been used

I'm wearing second hand hats, second hand clothes, that's why they call me Second Hand Rose
Even our piano in the parlor, father bought for ten cents on the dollar
Second hand pearls, I'm wearing second hand curls, I never get a single thing that's new
Even Jake the Plumber, he's the man I adore, had the nerve to tell me he's been married before
Everyone knows that I'm just Second Hand Rose, from Second Avenue, from Second Avenue. NEW?

SECOND TIME AROUND
Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young

Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

SECRET AGENT MAN
There's a man who leads a life of danger. To everyone he meets, he stays a stranger
And, with every move he makes, another chance he takes.
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow
	Secret agent man, secret agent man,
	They've given you a number, and taken away your name
Beware of pretty faces that you find. A pretty face can hide an evil mind
Oh, be careful what you say, you'll give yourself away
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow
	CHORUS
Swingin' on the Riviera one day, and then layin' in the Bombay alley next day
Oh, don't you let the wrong word slip, while kissing persuasive lips
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow.
	CHORUS

SECRET LOVE
Once I had a secret love that lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love became impatient to be free
So I told a friendly star the way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are and why I'm so in love with you
	Now I shout it from the highest hills
	Even told the golden daffodils.
	At last my heart's an open door
	And my secret love's no secret any more

THE SECRET OF LIFE
The secret of life is enjoying the passage of time
Any fool can do it. There ain't nothin' to it. Nobody knows how we got to the top of the hill
But, since we're on our way down, we might as well enjoy the ride

The secret of love is in opening up your heart
It's OK to feel afraid, but don't let that stand in your way
'Cause anyone knows that love is the only road
And, since we're only here for a while, we might as well show some style. Give us a smile
	Isn't it a lovely ride, sliding down, gliding down
	Try not to try too hard, it's just a lovely ride
Now, the thing about time is that time isn't really real
It's just your point of view. How does it feel for you?
Einstein said he could never understand it all
Planets spinning through space, the smile upon your face, now, welcome to the human race.
	Some kind of love in rhyme, I'll be slidin' down, I'll be flyin' down
	Try not to try too hard, it's just a lovely ride

	Isn't it a lovely ride, see me slidin' down, glidin' down
	Try not to try too hard, it's just a lovely ride

SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES
Seems like old times, having you to walk with
Seems like old times, having you to talk with
	And it's still a thrill just to have my arms around you
	Still the thrill that it was the day I found you
Seems like old times, dinner dates and flowers, seems like old times, staying up for hours
Making dreams come true, doing things we used to do
Seems like old times, being here with you.

SEE YOU IN SEPTEMBER
	I'll be at home each and every night, while you're away, don't forget to write
	Bye bye, so long, farewell, bye bye, so long
See you in September, see you when the summer's through
Here we are, saying goodbye at the station, summer vacation is taking you away.

Have a good time, but remember there is danger in the summer moon above
Will I see you in September, or lose you to a summer love.
	Counting the days till I'll be with you, counting the hours and the minutes too.
	Bye, baby, good-bye, bye, baby, good-bye; bye bye, so long, farewell, bye bye, so long
Have a good time, but remember there is danger in the summer moon above
Will I see you in September, or lose you to a summer love.
	I'll be at home each and every night, while you're away, don't forget to write
	Bye bye, so long, farewell, bye bye, so long!

SEE YOU LATER, ALLIGATOR
Well, I saw my baby walkin', with another man today,
Well, I saw my baby walkin', with another man today,
When I asked her "What's the matter?" this is what I heard her say.
    See you later alligator, after 'while, crocodile.  See you later alligator, after 'while, crocodile.
    Can't you see you're in my way now? Don't you know you cramp my style?
When I thought of what she told me, nearly made me lose my head,
When I thought of what she told me, nearly made me lose my head,
But, the next time that I saw her, reminded her of what she said
    See you later alligator, after 'while, crocodile.  See you later alligator, after 'while, crocodile.
    Can't you see you're in my way now? Don't you know you cramp my style?
She said, "I'm sorry, pretty daddy, you know my love is just for you. "
She said, "I'm sorry, pretty daddy, you know my love is just for you. "
Won't you say that you'll forgive me, and say your love for me is true. "

I said, "Wait a minute, 'gator, I know you mean it just for play. "
I said, "Wait a minute, 'gator, I know you mean it just for play. "
Don't you know you really hurt me, and this is what I have to say. "
    See you later alligator, after 'while, crocodile.  See you later alligator, after 'while, crocodile.
    Can't you see you're in my way now? Don't you know you cramp my style?
    See you later alligator, after 'while, crocodile.
    See you later alligator, so long, that's all, good-bye!

THE SEINE
One night along the river at St. Germain de Pre, I first met my beloved at a small sidewalk cafe.
We walked along the river, the shadows passing by,
But we only saw each other, the shining water and the sky.
 	The Seine, the Seine, when will I again
	Meet her there, greet her there on the moonlit banks of the Seine?
Standing there across the river, mid sound of horn and tram,
In all her quiet beauty, the Cathedral Notre Dame,
And as we passed beside her, I said a little prayer
That when this dream was over, I'd awake and find you there.
	Chorus  ("The Seine.....")
We walked along the river, till dawn was coming nigh.
Beneath the Eiffel Tower we said our last good-bye.
There on that splendid morning, I left you all in tears
And the beauty of that hour will shine within me through the years
	Chorus  ("The Seine.....")

SEMPER PARATUS  (COAST GUARD MARCHING SONG)
	From Aztec Shore to Arctic Zone, to Europe and Far East,
	The Flag is carried by our ships, in times of war and peace;
	And never have we struck it yet, in spite of foeman's might.
	Who cheered our crews and cheered again, for showing how to fight.
So here's the Coast Guard marching song, we sing on land and sea.
Through surf and storm and howling gale, high shall our purpose be.
"Semper Paratus" is our guide, our fame and glory too.
To fight to save or fight and die, aye! Coast Guard we are for you.

SEND ME THE PILLOW THAT YOU DREAM ON
Send me the pillow that you dream on, don't you know that I still care for you
Send me the pillow that you dream on, so, darlin', I can dream on it too
	Each night while I'm sleeping oh so lonely, I'll share your love in dreams that once were true
	Send me the pillow that you dream on, so, darlin', I can dream on it too
So send me the pillow that you dream on, maybe time will let our dreams come true
Send me the pillow that you dream on, so, darlin', I can dream on it too
	I've waited so long for you to write me, but just a memory's all that's left of you
	Send me the pillow that you dream on, so, darlin', I can dream on it too

SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY
Gonna take a Sentimental Journey, gonna set my heart at ease.
Gonna take a Sentimental Journey, to renew old memories.
Got my bag, I got my reservation, spent each dime I could afford.
Like a child in wild anticipation, long to hear that "all aboard."
Seven, that's the time we leave at seven, I'll be waiting up for heaven
Counting every mile of railroad track that takes me back.
Never thought my heart could be so yearny, why did I decide to roam?
Gonna take a Sentimental Journey, Sentimental Journey home.

SEPTEMBER IN THE RAIN
The leaves of brown came tumbling down, remember?
In September, in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying ember,
That September, in the rain
To every word of love I heard you whisper,
The raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain
Though Spring is here, to me it's still September,
That September, in the rain

SEPTEMBER SONG
When I was a young man, courting the girls, I played me a waiting game.
If a maid refused me with tossing curls I let the old earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls.
And as time came around, she came my way, as time came around she came.
	Oh it's a long, long, while from May to December
	But the days grow short when you reach September
	When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame, one hasn't got time for the waiting game.
	Oh the days dwindle down to a precious few, September, November!
	And these few precious days I'll spend with you, these precious days I'll spend with you.

THE SHADOW OF YOUR SMILE
	One day we walked along the sand, one day in early spring.
	You held a piper in your hand to mend its broken wing
	Now I'll remember many a day and many a lonely  mile
	The echo of a piper's song, the shadow of a smile.
The shadow of your smile when you are gone
Will color all my dreams and light the dawn
Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things you are to  me

Our wistful little star was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips and so did I
Now when I remember spring, all the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering the shadow of your smile
Now when I remember spring, all the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering the shadow of your smile

SHALOM
Shalom, Shalom you'll find Shalom the nicest greeting you know
It means bonjour, salud and skoal and twice as much as hello
It means a million lovely things like Peace  Be Yours, Welcome Home
And even when you say goodbye you say goodbye with Shalom
	It's a very useful word, it can get you through the day
	All you really need to know, you can hardly go wrong, this is your home, as long as you say
Shalom................ the nicest greeting I know
Shalom................ means twice as much as hello
It means a million lovely things like Peace  Be Yours, Welcome Home
And even when you say "goodbye," if your voice says, "I don't want to go" in it
Say "goodbye" with a little "hello" in it, and say goodbye with Shalom

SHAM-A-LING-DONG-DING
The boys were singing shing-a-ling the summer night we met,
You were tan and seventeen, oh, how could I for-get.
When every star from near and far was watching from above,
Watching  two  teenagers  fall in love.

The way we danced was not a dance, but more a long embrace,
We held on to each other, and we floated  there in space.
And I was shy to kiss you while the whole wide world could see,
So shing-a-ling said everything for me. 
	And oh, the poor old old folks, they thought we'd lost our minds,
	They could not make heads or tails of the young folks' funny rhymes.
	But you and I knew all the words, and we always sang a-long
	To oh, sham-a-ling-dong-ding, sham-a-ling-dang-dong.  
So after years and after tears and after summers passed
The old folks tried to warn us how our love would never last.
And all we'd get was soaking wet from walking in the rain
And singing sham-a-shing-a-ling a-gain. 
	And oh, the poor old old folks, they smile and walk away,
	 But I bet they did some sham-a-lama-ding-dong in their day.
	I bet that they still close their eyes and I bet they sing a-long
	To oh, sham-a-ling-dong-ding, sham-a-ling-dang..... 
Oh, sweet old love songs, boy, every word rings true,
Sham-a-ling-dong-ding means sweetheart, sham-a-ling-dang-dong does, too. 
And it means that right here in my arms, well, that's where you be-long,
And it means sham-a-ling-dong-ding, sham-a-ling-dang-dong.

SH-BOOM (LIFE COULD  BE A DREAM)
      Hey nonny ding dong, a-lang alang a-lang, boom ba-doh, ba-doo ba-doo-ba-day.
Oh, life could be a dream, if I could take you  up in paradise up above.

Hello, hello, again, sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again.

Oh, life could be a dream, if only all my precious plans would come true.
If you would let me spend my whole  life  lovin'  you, life could be a dream sweetheart.

SHE BELIEVES IN ME
While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says, "How was your night?"
And I come to her and say it was all right, and I hold her tight
	And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
	I told her someday, if she was my girl, I could change the world
	With my little songs, I was wrong
	But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
	And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right,
	I will find a way, find a way
While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me, like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through, God, her love is true
	And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
	I told her someday, if she was my girl, I could change the world
	With my little songs, I was wrong
	But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
	And who knows, maybe on some special night, if my song is right,
	I will find a way, while she waits, while she waits for me

SHE CRIED
And when I told her, I didn't love her anymore, she cried (she cried)
And when I told her, her kisses were not like before, she cried (she cried)
	I thought that our romance was over and done
	But to her it had just begun
And when I told her, another girl had caught my eye, she cried (she cried)
And when I kissed her, a kiss that only meant goodbye, she cried (she cried)

And when I told her, I didn't love her anymore, she cried (she cried)

SHE'D RATHER BE WITH ME
Some girls love to run around, love to handle everything they see
But my girl has more fun around, and you know she'd rather be with me
	Me-oh my, lucky guy is what I am, tell you why, you'll understand
	She don't fly, although she can
Some boys love to run around, they don't think about the things they do
But this boy wants to settle down, and you know he'd rather be with you
	Me-oh my, lucky guy is what I am, tell you why, you'll understand
	She don't fly, although she can
Some girls love to run around, love to handle everything they see
But my girl has more fun around, and you know she'd rather be with
Yeah, she'd rather be with, you know she'd rather be with me

Never knew a girl like a little Sheila, her name drives me insane
Sweet little girl, that's my little Sheila, man, this little girl is fine
	Me and Sheila go for a ride, oh-oh-oh-oh, I feel all funny inside

You think you've lost your love, well, I saw her yesterday
It's you she's thinking of, and she told me what to say
She says she loves you, and you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you, and you know you should be glad

She said you hurt her so, she almost lost her mind
But now she says she knows you're not the hurting kind

Yes, she loves you, and you know you should be glad, ooh!

SHENANDOAH
Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you, away you rolling river,
Oh Shenandoah I long to hear you, away I'm bound away, 'cross the wide Missouri

Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter, away you rolling river,
I'll take her 'cross you rollin' water, away I'm bound away, 'cross the wide Missouri

Oh Shenandoah, I'm bound to leave you, away you rolling river,
Oh Shenandoah I'll not deceive you, away I'm bound away, 'cross the wide Missouri

SHE'S A LADY
She's a lady, and I chanced to meet her in my scufflin' days
She's a lady, hypnotized me there that day, I came to  play in my usual way, hey
Floatin' along with the whimsical twinkling in her strange green eyes
Linger with me, she said, "Yes," and oh, the time did fly

She's a lady, give her time, for she's allowed to change her mind
She's a lady, happy to say, she once was mine. Only sometimes I remember old times.

And when she says, "Can you guess, it's a dress, you won't believe.
Would you come zip me up, and button up my sleeve."
Oh, lady of ladies. I remember days that felt like it was rainin' daisies!

SHE'S A WOMAN
My love don't give me presents, I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely, people tell me that she's only foolin', I know she isn't

She don't give boys the eye, she hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me say that I will never leave her
She don't give boys the eye
She will never make me jealous, give me all the time, as well as lovin', don't ask me why
She's a woman who understands, she's a woman who loves her man,

My love don't give me presents, I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely, people tell me that she's only foolin', I know she isn't
   Interlude
She's a woman who understands, she's a woman who loves her man,
My love don't give me presents, I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely, people tell me that she's only foolin', I know she isn't
	She's a woman, she's a woman, she's a woman, she's a woman.

SHE'S FUNNY THAT WAY
I'm not much to look at, nothin' to see, just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I've got a woman, crazy for me, she's funny that way
Can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent, she doesn't holler, she'd live in a tent
I've got a woman, crazy for me, she's funny that way
	Though she loves to work and slave for me every day
	She'd be so much better off if I went away
But, why should I leave her, why should I go? She'd be unhappy without me, I know
I've got a woman, crazy for me, she's funny that way
	She'd be so much better off if I went away
But, why should I leave her, why should I go? She'd be unhappy without me, I know
I've got a woman, crazy for me, she's funny that way

SHE'S GOT A WAY
She's got a way about her, I don't know what it is, but I know that I can't live without her
She's got a way of pleasin', I don't know why it is, but there doesn't have to be a reason, anyway

She's got a smile that heals me, I don't know why it is,
But it lifts me up when we are walkin' anywhere
	She comes to me when I'm feelin' down, inspires me, without a sound
	She touches me, and I get turned around
She's got a way of showin' how I make her feel, and I find the strength to keep on goin'
She's got a light around her, and everywhere she goes
A million dreams of love surround her, everywhere
	She comes to me when I'm feelin' down, inspires me, without a sound
	She touches me, and I get turned around
She's got a smile that heals me, I don't know why it is, but I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way about her, I don't know what it is, but I know that I can't live without her, anyway

HE'S/SHE'S GOT YOU
I've got your picture that you gave to me
And it's signed with love, just like it used to be
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got your picture, he's/she's got you

I've got the records that we used to share
And they still sound the same as when you were here
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got the records, he's/she's got you
	I've got your memory, or has it got me
	I really don't know, but I know it won't let me be
I've got your class ring that proves you cared
And it still looks the same as when you gave it, dear
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got these little things, he's/she's got you
	I've got your memory, or has it got me
	I really don't know, but I know it won't let me be
I've got your class ring that proves you cared
And it still looks the same as when you gave it, dear
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got these little things, he's/she's got you

SHE'S NOT THERE
Well no one told me about her, the way she lied
Well no one told me about her, how many people cried
	But it's too late to say you're sorry. How would I know, why should I care
	Please don't bother tryin' to find her, she's not there
     Well let me tell you 'bout the way she looked, the way she acted, the color of her hair
     Her voice was soft and cool, her eyes were clear and bright, but she's not there
Well no one told me about her, what could I do
Well no one told me about her, though they all knew
	But it's too late to say you're sorry. How would I know, why should I care
	Please don't bother tryin' to find her, she's not there
     Well let me tell you 'bout the way she looked, the way she acted, the color of her hair
     Her voice was soft and cool, her eyes were clear and bright, but she's not there

SHE'S NOT YOU
Her hair is soft and her eyes are oh so blue
She's all the things a girl should be, but she's not you.

She knows just how to make me laugh when I feel blue
She's everything a man could want, but she's not you.
	And when we're dancing, it almost feels the same
	I've got to stop myself from whispering your name
She even kisses me like you used to do
And it's just breaking my heart 'cause she's not you.
And it's just breaking my heart 'cause she's not you.

SHE TOUCHED ME
She touched me, she put her hand near mine, and then she touched me
I felt a sudden tingle when she touched me, a sparkle, a glow
She knew it, it wasn't accidental, no she knew it
She smiled, and seemed to tell me so all through it, she knew it, I know
	She's real, and the world is alive and shining
	I feel such a wonderful drive toward Valentining
She touched me, I simply have to face the fact, she touched me
Control myself, and try to act as if I remember my name
But she touched me, she touched me, and suddenly nothing is the same

SHE WORKS HARD FOR THE MONEY
	She works hard for the money, so hard for it, honey.
	She works hard for the money, so you better treat her right  (X2)
I met her there in the corner stand, and she wonders where she is
And it's strange to her, some people seem to have everything
Nine a.m. on the hour hand, and she's waiting for the bell
And she's looking real pretty, just waiting for her clientele
	She works hard for the money, so hard for it, honey.
	She works hard for the money, so you better treat her right  (X2)
Twenty-eight years have come and gone, and she's seen a lot of tears
Of the ones who come in, they really seem to need her there
It's a sacrifice, working day to day, for little money, just tips for pay
But it's worth it all to hear them say that they care
	She works hard for the money, so hard for it, honey.
	She works hard for the money, so you better treat her right
     Already knows she's seen her bad times. Already knows these are the good times
     She'll never sell out, she never will, not for a dollar bill, she works hard
	She works hard for the money, so hard for it, honey.
	She works hard for the money, so you better treat her right  (X2)

SHINE ON HARVEST MOON
Shine on, shine on harvest moon, up in the sky.
I ain't had no lovin' since January, February, June or July.
Snow time ain't no time to stay out-doors and spoon,
So shine on, shine on harvest moon, for me and my gal.

SHINE ON YOUR SHOES
When you feel as low as the bottom of a well and can't get out of the mood
Do something to perk yourself up, change your attitude.
Give a tug to your tie, put a crease in your pants, but if you really want to feet fine,
Give your shoes a shine.

When there's a shine on your shoes, there's a melody in your heart.
With a singable happy feelin', a wonderful way to start.
To face the world every day with a dee-dle dum dee da da
A little melody that is makin' the worryin' world go by
	When you walk down the street, with a happy go lucky beat,
	You'll find a lot of what I'll repeat.
When there's a shine on your shoes and a melody in your heart
What a wonderful way to start the day.

SHOP AROUND
When I became of age, my mama called me to her side.
She said, "Son, you're growing up now, pretty soon you'll take a bride." And then she said:
Just because you've become a young man now, there's still some things that you don't understand, now.
Before you ask some girl for her hand, now, keep your freedom for as long as you can, now.
    My mama told me, you'd better shop around, oh yeah, you better shop around.
There's some things that I want you to know, now, just as sure as the wind's gonna blow, now,
The women come and the women gonna go, now, before you tell 'em that you love 'em so, now,
    My mama told me, you'd better shop around, oh yeah, you better shop a-round.
	    Try to get yourself a bargain, son, don't be sold on the very first one.
	     Pretty girls come a dime a dozen, try to find one who's gonna give you true lovin'.
Before you take a girl and say "I do" now, make sure she's in love with you, now
Make sure that her love is true, now, I'd hate to see you feeling sad and blue, now,
    My mama told me, You'd better shop around. Uh huh, don't let the first one get  ya,
Under-stand, my son, be a man, my son, I know ya can my son,
    My mama told me, you'd better shop a-round!

SHUFFLE OFF TO BUFFALO
	Now that we have had the  rice and flowers, the knot is tied
	I can visualize such happy hours, close by your side
	The honeymoon in store, is one that you'll adore
	I'm gonna  take you for a ride.
You go home and get your panties, I'll go home and get my scanties, and away we'll go, mm mm mm.
Off we're gonna shuffle, shuffle off to Buffalo.
To Niagara in a sleeper, there's no honeymoon that's cheaper, and the train goes slow. Oh, oh, oh!
Off we're gonna shuffle, shuffle off to Buffalo.
	Someday the stork may pay a visit, and leave a little souvenir
	Just a little cute "what is it," but we'll discuss that later, dear.
For a little silver quarter, we can have the pullman porter turn the lights down low. Oh!
Off we're gonna shuffle, shuffle off to Buffalo.

SIDE BY SIDE
Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money, maybe we're ragged and funny,
But we'll travel  along, singin' a song, side by side.
Oh, we don't know what's comin' tomorrow, maybe it's trouble and sorrow,
But we'll travel the road, sharin' our load, side by side.
Through all kinds of weather, what if the sky should fall?
Just as long as we're together, it doesn't matter at all.
When they've all had their quarrels and parted, we'll be the same as we started,
Just travelin' along, singin' a song, side..... by... side.

SIDEWALKS OF NEW YORK
East side, West side, all around the town,
The tots sang  "ring a rosie, London Bridge is falling down
Boys and girls together, me and Mamie O'Rourke
Tripped the light fantastic on the sidewalks of New York
	Down in front of Casey's old brown wooden stoop
	On a summer's evening, we formed a merry group
	Boys and girls together, we would sing and waltz
	While Tony played the organ on the sidewalks of New York
Repeat 1st verse

SILENT NIGHT
Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright,
Round yon virgin mother and child, holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace.
Silent night, holy night, shepherds quake at the sight,
Glories stream from heaven afar, heavenly hosts sing Alleluia;
Christ the Savior is born! Christ the Savior is born!

SILHOUETTES
Took a walk and passed your house late last night,
All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
From within a dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade,
	Oh, what a lovely couple they made
Put his arms around your waist, held you tight,
Kisses I could almost taste in the night
Wondered why I'm not the guy whose silhouette's on the shade
	I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes.
		Silhouettes X6                                      Silhouettes X6
Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
"Let me in or else I'll beat down your door."
When two strangers, who had been two silhouettes on the shade
	Said to my shock, "You're on the wrong block."
Rushed down to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I've never loved you my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade
	All of our days, two silhouettes on the shade.

SILVER BELLS
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks, dressed in holiday style,
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas.
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile,
And on ev'ry street corner you hear:
	Silver bells, silver bells, it's Christmas time in the city.
	Ringaling, hear them ring, soon it will be Christmas day.
Strings of street lights, even stop lights, blink a bright red and green,
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures.
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch, this is Santa's big scene,
And above all this bustle you hear:
	Silver bells, silver bells, it's Christmas time in the city.
	Ringaling, hear them ring, soon it will be Christmas day.

SILVER THREADS AND GOLDEN NEEDLES
I don't want your lonely mansion, with a tear in every room
All I want's the love you promised beneath the haloed moon.
But you think I could be happy with your money and your name
And drown myself in sorrow while you play your cheatin' game
	Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
	And I dare not drown my sorrows in the warm glow of your wine
	You can't buy my love with money, 'cause I never was that kind
	Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine.

SINCE I DON'T HAVE YOU
I don't have plans and schemes, and  I don't have hopes and dreams.
I don't have anything, since I don't have you.
I don't have fond desires, and I don't have happy hours.
I don't have anything, since I don't have you.
	   I don't have happiness, and I guess, I never will ever a-gain.
	  When you walked out on me, in walked old misery, and he's been here since then.
I don't have love to share, and I don't have one who cares.
I don't have anything, since I don't have
    You,      you,        you,      you,     you,       you,        you,      you, Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo

SINCE I FELL FOR YOU
     When you just give love, and never get love, you'd better let love depart.
      I know it's so, and yet I know, I can't get you out of my heart.
You made me leave my happy home.
You took my love, and now you've gone, since I fell for you ...

Love brings such misery and pain.
 I guess I'll never be the same, since I fell for you ...
	Well it's too bad, and it's too sad, but I'm in love with you
	You love me, then you snub me. But what can I do, I'm still in love with you.
Well, I guess I'll never see the light. I get the blues most every night,
Since I fell for you ... Since I fell for you.

SINCE I KISSED MY BABY GOODBYE
Evenin' creeping down the mountain wakes up mister fire-fly
Bullfrog settin' there starts a-croakin', but I don't care
Since I kissed my baby good-bye

South wind shakes the old magnolia, moon man lights the dingy sky
Star, star sprinklin' gold on the river, but still I'm cold, since I kissed my baby good-bye
     Since my baby and me parted company, I can't see what's the diff' if I live or I die
Oh Lord, I'm takin' such a beatin' I'm no good, even cheatin'
Since I kissed my baby good-bye
	Evenin' creeping down the mountain wakes up mister fire-fly
	Bullfrog settin' there starts a-croakin', but I don't care
	Since I kissed my baby good-bye
South wind shakes the old magnolia, moon man lights the dingy sky
Star, star sprinklin' gold on the river, but still I'm cold, since I kissed my baby good-bye
     Since my baby and me parted company, I can't see what's the diff' if I live or I die
Oh Lord, I'm takin'  such a beatin' I'm no good, even cheatin'
Since I kissed my baby  (X3)   good-bye

SINCE I LOST MY BABY
The sun is shinin', there's plenty of light. A new day is dawnin', sunny and bright
But after I've been cryin' all night, the sun is cold, and the new day seems old
	Since I lost my baby. (Since I lost my baby.)
	Oh, since I lost my baby. (Oh, since I lost my baby.)
The birds are singin' and the children are playin'
There's plenty of work and the bosses are payin'
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore and with money I'm poor.
	Since I lost my baby. (Since I lost my baby.)
	Oh, since I lost my baby. (Oh, since I lost my baby.)
     Next time I'll be kinder. Won't you please help me find her
     Someone just remind her of this love she left behind her
     Till I find her I'll be tryin' ta, everyday I'm more inclined ta
     Find her, inclined ta find her, inclined ta find my baby
     Been lookin' everywhere (ba--by) Baby, I really, really care!
Oh, determination is fadin' fast. Inspiration is a thing of the past
Can't see how my hope's gonna last. Good things are bad and what's happy is sad
	Since I lost my baby. (Since I lost my baby.)
	Oh, since I lost my baby. (Oh, since I lost my baby.)
     I feel so bad (since I lost my baby), I feel so sad (since I lost my baby)
     Everything is wrong (SILMB), This heart is hard to carry on (SILMB)
     I'm lost as can be (since I lost my baby), What's gonna happen to me?

SINCE I MET YOU, BABY
Since I met you baby, my whole life has changed. Since I met you baby, my whole life has changed
	And everybody tells me, that I am not the same
I don't need nobody, to tell my troubles to. I don't need nobody, to tell my troubles to
	'Cause since I met you baby, all I need is you
Since I met you baby, I'm a happy man. Since I met you baby, I'm a happy man
I'm gonna try to please you, in every way I can. I'm gonna try to please you, in every way I can

SINCERELY
Sincerely, oh, yes, sincerely, 'cause I love you so dearly, please say you'll be mine
Sincerely, oh, you know how I love  you, I'll do anything for you, please say you'll be mine
	Oh, Lord, won't you tell me why I love that girlie so,
	She doesn't want me, oh, I'll never, never, never, never let her go.
Sincerely, oh, you know how I love  you, I'll do anything for you, please say you'll be mine

SING
Sing, sing a song. Sing out loud, sing out strong
Sing of good things not bad. Sing of happy not sad.
	Sing, sing a song. Make it simple to last your whole life long
	Don't worry that it's not good enough for anyone else to hear
	Just sing, sing a song.
Sing, sing a song. Let the world sing along
Sing of love there could be. Sing for you and for me.
	Sing, sing a song. Make it simple to last your whole life long
	Don't worry that it's not good enough for anyone else to hear
	Just sing, sing a song.  Just sing, sing a song.

SING HALLELUJAH
I know we got a long, long journey well, sing hallelujah
We better get started early, well, sing hallelujah
Sing out for the Lord to help you for the Lord is mighty strong
Don't worry 'bout your heavy load, the Lord's gonna help you along
Last night I heard my Lord callin' well, sing hallelujah

You sure better quit your stallin' well, sing hallelujah
Sing out for the Lord to help you for the Lord is mighty strong
Don't worry 'bout your heavy load, the Lord's gonna help you along
I don't know but I've been told well, sing hallelujah
If you sing and clap you can save your soul, well, sing hallelujah
Sing out for the Lord to help you for the Lord is mighty strong
Don't worry 'bout your heavy load, the Lord's gonna help you along
Don't worry 'bout your heavy load, the Lord's gonna, Lord's gonna help you along!

SINGING THE BLUES
Well, I never felt more like singing the blues,
 'Cause I never thought that I'd ever lose your love, dear,
Why'd you do me this way

Well, I never felt more like crying all night
 'Cause everythin's wrong, and nothin' ain't right without you,
You got me singing the blues
	The moon and stars no longer shine, the dream is gone I thought was mine
	There's nothing left for me to do but cry-y-y-y over you
Well, I never felt more like running away,
But why should I go 'cause I couldn't stay without you, you got me singing the blues.

SINGIN' IN THE RAIN
I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain, what a glorious feeling, I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds, so dark up above, the sun's in my heart, and I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place, come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I walk down the lane with a happy refrain, just singin', singin' in the rain.

SINGLE SADDLE
Gee, but I get a tingle, riding clippity clop atop my single saddle
Women, they try to tempt me, but the minute the pantry's empty, I ske-daddle, single saddle
Leading my horse to  water, with a clippity clop I meet a neighbor's daughter
Some of them talk so flowery, but the minute they show their dowry, I'm a-straddle, single saddle
Ain't a filly been born, be she  rose or a thorn, gonna keep me from the lone prairie.
When they're 'roundin' up strays, all they ever get are neighs from my palomino pal and me
Oh, when they get out a halter for a-hitchin' me to the altar I ske-daddle,  I'm a-straddle
With a clippity clop, I hop atop my sin......gle saddle.

SINKING OF THE REUBEN JAMES
Have you heard of the ship called the good Reuben James?
Run by hard fighting men both of honor and of fame
She flew the Stars and Stripes of the land of the free
But tonight she's in her grave at the bottom of the sea
	Tell me, what were their names, tell me, what were their names?
	Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
	Oh, tell me, what were their names, tell me, what were their names?
	Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
One hundred men went down to their dark and watery graves
When that good ship went down, only forty-four were saved
T'was the last of October, they saved forty-four
From the dark, icy waters of that cold Iceland shore
	Chorus
It was there in the dark, on that cold and watery night
That they watched for the U-boats, and they waited for a fight
Then a whine, and a rock, and a great explosion's roar
They lay the Reuben James on the cold ocean floor
	Chorus
Many years have passed, since those brave men are gone
Those cold, icy waters, they're still, and they're calm
Many years have passed, and still I wonder why
The worst of men must fight, and the best of men must die!
	Chorus

SIR DUKE
Music is a world within itself, with a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity, for all to sing, dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove, don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A, when the people start to  move
	They can feel it all over,  they can feel it all over people X2
Music knows it is and always will be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers that time will not allow us to for-get
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo, and the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out, there's no way  the band can  lose
	You can feel it all over, you can feel it all over, people  X4

SISTER GOLDEN HAIR
Well, I tried to make it Sunday, but I got so damned depressed,
That I set my sights on Monday, and I got myself undressed
I ain't ready for the altar, but I do agree there's times,
When a woman sure can be a friend of mine

Well, I keep on thinkin' 'bout you, Sister Golden Hair surprise,
And I just can't live without you; can't you see it in my eyes?
I been one poor correspondent, and I been too, too hard to find,
But it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind
　　　　Will you meet me in the middle, will you meet me in the air?
　　　　Will you love me just a little, just enough to show you care?
　　　　Well I tried to fake it, I don't mind sayin', I just can't make it
Well, I keep on thinkin' 'bout you, Sister Golden Hair surprise,
And I just can't live without you; can't you see it in my eyes?
I been one poor corre-spondent, and I been too, too hard to find,
But it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind
　　　　Will you meet me in the middle, will you meet me in the air?
　　　　Will you love me just a little, just enough to show you care?
　　　　Well I tried to fake it, I don't mind sayin', I just can't make it
Doo wop shoo wop, Doo wop shoo wop, Doo wop shoo wop, Doo wop shoo wop
Doo wop shoo wop, Doo wop shoo wop, Doo wop shoo wop, Doo wop shoo wop
Doo wop shoo wop, Doo wop shoo wop, Doo wop shoo wop, Doo wop shoo wop
Doo wop shoo wop, Doo wop shoo wop, Doo wop shoo wop

SISTERS, SISTERS
Sisters, sisters, there were never such devoted sisters
Never had to have a chaperone "No sir," I'm there to keep an eye on her
Caring, sharing, every little thing that we are wearing
When a certain gentleman arrived from Rome, she wore the dress and I stayed home
All kinds of weather, we stick together, the same in the rain and sun
Two different faces, but in tight places, we think and we act as one
Those who've seen us know that not a thing could come between us
Many men have  tried to split us up, but no one can
Lord help the mister who comes between me and my sister.
And Lord help the sister who comes between me and my man

SITTIN' ON THE DOCK OF THE BAY
Sittin' in the morning sun, I'll be sittin' when the evening comes
Watching the ships roll in, then I watch them roll away again, yeah
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay, watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time
I left my home in Georgia, headed for the Frisco Bay
'cause I've had nothing to live for, and look like nothing's gonna come my way
So, I'm just gon' sit on the dock of the bay, watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time
	Looks like nothing's gonna change. Everything still remains the same
	I can't do what ten people tell me to do, so I guess I'll remain the same,
Sittin' here resting my bones, and this loneliness won't leave me  alone,
Two thousand miles I roam, just to make this dock  my home, now
I'm just gon' sit at the dock of a bay, watchin' the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time
 (Whistling)

SIXTEEN CANDLES
	Happy birthday, happy birthday, baby, oh, I love you so
Sixteen candles make a lovely light, but not as bright as your eyes tonight
Blow out the candles, make your wish come true, for I'll be wishing that you love me, too
	You're only sixteen, but you're my teenage queen
	You're the prettiest, loveliest girl I've ever seen
Sixteen candles in my heart will glow, for ever and ever,  for I love you so
	You're only sixteen, but you're my teenage queen
	You're the prettiest, loveliest girl I've ever seen
Sixteen candles in my heart will glow, for ever and ever,  for I love you so, for I love you so!

SIXTEEN GOING ON SEVENTEEN
You are sixteen, going on  seventeen, baby, it's time to think
Better beware, be canny and careful, baby, you're on the brink
You are sixteen, going on  seventeen , fellows will fall in line
Eager young lads and roués and cads will offer you food and wine
Totally unprepared are you to face a world of men
Timid and shy and scared are you of things beyond your ken
You need someone older and wiser telling you what to do
I am seventeen, going on eighteen, I'll take care of you.

SIXTEEN TONS
Some people say a man is made out of mud, a poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones, a mind that's weak and a back that's strong
	You load sixteen tons and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt
	St. Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go. I owe my soul to the company's store.
I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine, I picked up my shovel and walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal, and the straw boss said, "Well, bless my soul!"
	You load sixteen tons and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt
	St. Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go. I owe my soul to the company's store.
I was born one morning, it was drizzlin' rain, fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebreak by an ol' mama lion, ain't no hi-toned woman make me walk the line.
	You load sixteen tons and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt
	St. Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go. I owe my soul to the company's store.
If you see me comin' better step aside, a lot of men didn't and a lot of men died
One fist of iron and the other of steel, if the right one doesn't get you then the left one will.
	You load sixteen tons and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt
	St. Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go. I owe my soul to the company's store.

SKINNAMARINK
Skinnamarinkydinkydink.  Skinnamarinkydoo.     I -   Love - You!
Skinnamarinkydinkydink.  Skinnamarinkydoo.    I -    Love - You!
I love you in the morning and in the afternoon.
I love you in the evening, underneath the moon.
Oh,  Skinnamarinkydinkydink.  Skinnamarinkydoo
    I  -  Love - You!    (I love your singing!)
    I  -  Love – You   (You're all ter-rific!)
    I  -  Love – You  (We'll dig you next time!)
    I ----- Love ------ You....You....(Boop, boop, ee-doo)

SKYLARK
Skylark, have you anything to say to me? Won't you tell me where my love can be?     
Is there a meadow in the mist, where someone's waiting to be kissed?
Oh, skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring, where my heart can go a-journeying,
Over the shadows and the rain to a blossom-covered lane
	And in your lonely flight, haven't you heard the music in the night
	Wonderful music, faint as a  will o' the wisp, crazy as a  loon,
	Sad as a gypsy, serenading the moon.      
Oh, skylark, I don't know if you can find these things,
But my heart is riding on your wings,  
So, if you see them anywhere, won't you lead me there?

SLEEPY TIME GAL
Wouldn't it be a change for you and me to stay at home once in a while?
We'd cabaret until the break of day I'll bet that we'd dance many a mile
I'd like to see a movie once more they don't keep people staying up until four
Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?

Sleepy time gal you're turning night into day, sleepy time gal you dance the evening away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight, please give me one little kiss 
And then let us whisper "Goodnight," it's getting late and dear your pillow's waiting

Sleepy time gal when all your dancing is through, sleepy time gal I'll find a cottage for you
You'll learn to cook and to sew, what's more, you love it, I know
When you're a stay-at-home, play-at-home, eight o'clock sleepy time gal
When you're a stay-at-home, play-at-home, eight o'clock sleepy time gal

SLEIGH RIDE
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, rin-ting-tingle-ing too.
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "Yoo-hoo."
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.
	Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, let's go, let's look at the show.
	We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
	Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, it's grand, just holding your hand.
	We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.
Our cheeks are nice and rosy, and comfy cozy are we.
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two.
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together (X3) with you.

SLIP SLIDIN' AWAY
	Slip slidin' away, slip slidin' away
	You know the nearer your destination, the more you're slip slidin' away
I know a man, he came from my home town
He wore his passion for his woman like a thorny crown
He said, "Dolores, I live in fear. My love for you's so overpowering, I'm afraid that I will disappear
	Slip slidin' away, slip slidin' away
	You know the nearer your destination, the more you're slip slidin' away
I know a woman, became a wife. These are the very words she uses to describe her life
She said a good day ain't got no rain
She said a bad day's when I lie in bed, and think of things that might have been
	Slip slidin' away, slip slidin' away
	You know the nearer your destination, the more you're slip slidin' away
And, I know a father, he had a son. He longed to tell him all the reasons for the things he'd done
He came a long way, just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping, then he turned around, and headed home again
	He's slip slidin' away, slip slidin' away
	You know the nearer your destination, the more you're slip slidin' away
God only knows, God makes his plans, the information's unavailable to the mortal man
We're workin' our jobs, collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the highway, when, in fact, we're slip slidin' away
	Slip slidin' away, slip slidin' away
	You know the nearer your destination, the more you're slip slidin' away  (X2)

SLOOP JOHN B
We come on the sloop John B, my grandfather and me
'Round Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night, got into a fight
Well I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
	So hoist up the John B's sails, see how the mainsail sets
	Call for the Captain ashore, let me go home,
	Let me go home, I wanna go home
	Well I feel so broke up, I wanna go home
The first mate he got drunk, and broke in the Cap'n's trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone, why don't you leave me alone
Well I feel so broke up I wanna go home

The poor cook he caught the fits, and threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home, why don't they let me go home
This is the worst trip I've ever been on
	So hoist up the John B's sails, see how the mainsail sets
	Call for the Captain ashore, let me go home,
	Let me go home, I wanna go home
	Well I feel so broke up, I wanna go home X3

SLOW POKE
You keep me waitin' till it's gettin' aggravatin', you're a slow poke
I wait and worry, but you never seem to hurry, you're a slow poke
	Time means nothing to you, I wait, and then
	Late again, eight o'clock, nine o'clock, quarter to ten
Why should I linger every time you snap your finger, little slow poke
Why can't you hasten when you see the time's a wastin', you're a slow poke, dear
Why should I keep tryin' to change you, it's not the thing to do
I guess I'll have to be a slow poke too!

SMALL WORLD
Funny, you're a stranger who's come here, come from another town
Funny, I'm a stranger myself here, small world, isn't it

Funny, you're a girl/man who goes traveling, rather than settling down
Funny, 'cause I'd love to go traveling, small world, isn't it
　　　　We have so much in common, it's a phenomenon
　　　　We could pool our resources, by joining forces from now on
Lucky, you're a girl/man who likes children, that's an important sign
Lucky, 'cause I'd love to have children, small world, isn't it,
Funny, isn't it? Small, and funny, and fine

SMILE
Smile, though your heart is aching, smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by, if you
Smile through your fear and sorrow, smile, and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through for you
Light up your face with gladness, hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near, that's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying,
You'll find that life is still worthwhile, if you'll just smile.

SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES
They asked me how I knew my true love was true
I of course replied "something here inside cannot be denied"
They said "someday you'll find all who love are blind"
When your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love
Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say "when a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes"

SO FAR AWAY
So far away,  doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away

Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
Oh, how I wish I could
But you're so far away

One more song about moving along the highway
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
I'd rather spend it being close to you

But you're so far away, doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away, yeh, yeh, you're so far away

Traveling around sure gets me down and lonely
Nothing else to do but close my mind
I sure hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams I've yet to find

But you're so far away, doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're so far away, yeh, you're so far away
Hey, you're so far......away

SO IN LOVE
Strange dear, but true dear, when I'm close to you, dear, the stars fill the sky,
So in love with you am I.
Even without you, my arms fold about you, you know darling why,
So in love with you am I.
	In love with the night mysterious, the night when you first were there,
	In love with my joy delirious, when I knew that you could care,
So taunt me, and hurt me, deceive me, desert me, I'm yours, till I die.....
So in love.... So in love....So in love with you, my love... am I....

SOLITAIRE
There was a man, a lonely man, who lost his love through his indifference.
A heart that cared, that went unshared, until it died in his silence.
	And Solitaire's the only game in town, and every road that takes him, takes him down.
	While life goes on around him everywhere, he's playing Solitaire.
	And, keeping to himself, begins to deal, and still, the king of hearts is well concealed
	Another losing game comes to an end, and he deals them out again
A little hope goes up in smoke. Just how it goes, goes without saying.
There was a man, a lonely man, who would command the hand he's playing
	And Solitaire's the only game in town, and every road that takes him, takes him down.
	While life goes on around him everywhere, he's playing Solitaire.
	And, keeping to himself, begins to deal, and still, the king of hearts is well concealed
	Another losing game comes to an end, and he deals them out again
And Solitaire's the only game in town, and every road that takes him, takes him down.
While life goes on around him everywhere, he's playing Solitaire.

SOLITARY MAN
Belinda was mine 'til the time that I found her, holdin' Jim, lovin' him
Then Sue came along, loved me strong, that's what I thought. But me and Sue, that died, too.
	Don't know that I will, but until I can find me
	A girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me
	I'll be what I am, a solitary man, a solitary man
I've had it to here, being where love's a small word, a part time thing, a paper ring
I know it's been done havin' one girl who loves you, right or wrong, weak or strong
	Don't know that I will but until I can find me
	A girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me
	I'll be what I am, a solitary man, a solitary man

SOMEBODY LOVES ME
Somebody loves me. I wonder who, I wonder who she can be
Somebody loves me. I wish I knew, who can she be worries me.
For every girl who passes me I shout, "Hey, maybe,
You were meant to be my loving baby
Somebody loves me.  I wonder who, maybe it's you.

SOMEBODY'S KNOCKIN'
Somebody's knockin', should I let him in? Lord, it's the Devil, would you look at him
I've heard about him, but I never dreamed he'd have blue eyes and blue jeans
Well, somebody's talkin', he's whisperin' to me, your place or my place, well, which will it be?
I'm gettin' weaker and he's comin' on strong, but I don't wanna go wrong
     He must have tapped my telephone line, he must have known, I'm spendin' my time alone
     He says we'll have one heavenly night, my fever's burnin', so he ought be right at home
Somebody's knockin', should I let him in? Lord, it's the Devil, would you look at him
I've heard about him, but I never dreamed he'd have blue eyes and blue jeans
Well, somebody's talkin', he's whisperin' to me, your place or my place, well, which will it be?
I'm gettin' weaker and he's comin' on strong, but I don't wanna go wrong
     He must have tapped my telephone line, he must have known, I'm spendin' my time alone
     He says we'll have one heavenly night, my fever's burnin', so he ought be right at home
    (Somebody's knockin'), Somebody's knockin', somebody's knockin'  (fade)

SOMEBODY STOLE MY GAL
Somebody stole my gal, somebody stole my pal
Somebody came and took her away, she didn't even say she was leavin'
Her kisses I love so, he's gettin' now, I know
And gee, I know that she would come to me, if she could see
Her broken-hearted lonesome pal, somebody stole my gal

Somebody stole my gal, somebody stole my pal
Somebody came and took her away, she didn't even say she was leavin'
Her kisses I love so, he's gettin' now, I know
And gee, I know that she would come to me, if she could see
Her broken-hearted lonesome pal, somebody stole my gal
Somebody stole my gal,  somebody stole my gal,

SOMEDAY SOON
There's a young man that I know, just turned twenty-one,  comes from down in southern Colorado
Just out of the service,  and lookin' for his fun, someday soon, goin' with him, someday soon
My parents cannot stand him 'cause he works the rodeo, my father says that he will leave me cryin'
I would follow him right down the roughest road I know, someday soon, goin' with him someday soon
  	But when he comes to call, my pa ain't got a good word to say
  	Guess it's 'cause he's just as wild in his younger days
So blow, you old Blue Northern, blow him back to me, he's ridin' in tonight from California
He loves his damned old rodeo as much as he loves me, someday soon, goin' with him someday soon

SOMEDAY YOU'LL WANT ME TO WANT YOU
I know that someday you'll want me to want you
When I'm in love with somebody else
You expect me to be true and keep on loving you
Though I am feeling blue, you think I can't forget you
Until someday you'll want me to want you
When I am strong for somebody new
And though you don't want me now, I'll get along somehow
And then I won't want you

I know that someday you're gonna want me to want you
When I am strong for somebody new
And though you don't want me now, I'll get along somehow
And then I won't want you
And though you don't want me now, I'm bound to get along somehow
And then I won't want you

SOME ENCHANTED EVENING
Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somewhere you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.
	Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
	Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.
Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.
	Once you have found her, never let her go,
	Once you have found her, never let her go.

SOME FUN OUT OF LIFE
When we want to love, we love, when we want to kiss, we kiss
With a little petting, we're getting some fun out of life
When we want to work, we work, when we want to play, we play
In a happy setting, we're getting some fun out of life
Maybe we do the right things, maybe we do the wrong
Spending each day, wending our way along
But when we want to sing, we sing, when we want to dance, we dance
You can do your betting, we're getting some fun out of life
You can do your betting, we're getting some fun out of life

SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL
All you have to do is touch my hand, to show me you understand
And something happens to me that's some kind of wonderful
And any time my little world seems blue, I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful
	I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
	There's so much I wanna say, but the right words just don't come my way
	I just know when I'm in your embrace, this world is a happy place
	And something happens to me that's some kind of wonderful
Some kind of sweet lips, some kind of warm eyes
Some kind of soft sigh, there's some kind of wonderful, oh yeah wonderful

SOME OF THESE DAYS
Some of these days you're gonna miss me, honey
Some of these days you're gonna be so lonely
You'll miss my hugging, you're gonna miss my  kissing
You'll be so sorry, when I'm away
Now you're gonna be lonely just for me only
'Cause you know honey you've had your way
And when you  leave me, you know it's gonna grieve me
You'll miss your little daddy, yes, some of these days

SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME
	There's a saying old, says that love is blind
	Still, we're often told, "Seek and ye shall find."
	So I'm going to seek a  certain girl I've had in mind.
		Looking every-where, haven't found her yet
		She's the big af-fair  I can-not forget
		Only  girl I ever  think of  with regret
	 I'd like to add her initials to my monogram.
	Tell  me, where is the shepherdess for this lost lamb?
There's a somebody I'm longing to see,  I hope that she, turns out to be someone who'll watch over me.
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood, I know I could, always be good to one who'll watch over me.
              Although I may not be the man some girls think of as handsome, to her heart I'll carry the key
Won't you tell her please to put on some speed, follow my lead,  oh how I need.
Someone to  watch over me, someone to watch over me,

SOMETHING
Something in the way she moves, attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
	I don't want to leave her now, you know I believe, and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows that I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me,
	I don't want to leave her now, you know I believe, and how
     You're asking me, will my love grow? I don't know, I don't know
     Just stick around, now, it may show, I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows, and all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
	I don't want to leave her now, you know I believe, and how!

SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE
When an iresistable force, such as you, meets an old immovable object like me
You can bet as sure as you live,
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give, something's gotta give
When an irrepressible smile such as yours, warms an old implacable heart such as mine
Don't say no because I insist, somewhere, somehow, someone's gonna be kissed
	So en guard, who knows what the fates have in store from their vast, mysterious sky
	I'll try hard ignoring those lips I adore, but how hard can anyone try?
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might, chances are some heavenly star-spangled night
We'll find out, as sure as we live,
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give, something's gotta give
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give, something's gotta give

SOMETHING STUPID
I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid, like I love you
	I can see it in your eyes that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
	And, though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say, to make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid, like I love you

The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid, like I love you,
I love you, I love you

SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
People are talking, talking 'bout people, I hear them whisper, you won't believe it
They think we're lovers, kept under cover, I just ignore it, but they keep saying
	We laugh just a little too loud, we stand just a little too close
	We stare just a little too long, maybe they're seeing somethin' we don't, darlin'
     Let's give them something to talk about, let's give them something to talk about
     Let's give them something to talk about, how about love
I feel so foolish, I never noticed you'd act so nervous, could you be falling for me
It took the rumor to make me wonder, now I'm convinced that I'm goin' under
	Thinkin' 'bout you every day, dreamin' 'bout you every night
	I'm hopin' that you feel the same way. Now that we know it, let's really show it, darlin'
Let's give them somethin' to talk about,      a little mystery to figure out
Let's give them somethin' to talk about, how about love, love, love
        Let's give them somethin' to talk about, babe, a little mystery to figure out
        Let's give them somethin' to talk about, how about love, love, love, how about love

SOMETIMES I'M HAPPY
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue, my disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies, if I can find the sun in your eyes.
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you, but when I hate you, it's cause I love you.
That's how I am, so what can I do? I'm happy when I'm with you.

SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY
 I used to walk with you  along the avenue, our hearts were carefree and  gay
 How could I  know I'd  lose you  somewhere along  the  way
The friends we used to know would always smile hello, no love like our love, they'd say
Then love slipped through our fingers somewhere along the way
I should forget,  but with the loneliness of  night
I start remembering... everything... you're gone and yet
There's still a  feeling deep inside that you will always  be  part of me
So now I look for you along the avenue, and as I wander I pray
That someday soon I'll find you somewhere along the way

SOMEWHERE, MY LOVE
Somewhere, my love, there will be songs to sing,
Although the snow covers the hope of spring.

Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold
And there are dreams, all that your heart can hold.
	Someday we'll meet again, my love.
	Someday whenever the spring breaks through.
You'll come to me, out of the long ago,
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow.
Till then, my sweet, think of me now and then.
God-speed, my love, 'til you are mine again.
	Where are the beautiful days? Where are the sleigh rides to dawn?
	Where are the tender moments of splendor? Where have they gone, where have they gone?
Somewhere, my love, there will be songs to sing,
Although the snow covers the hope of spring.
Till then, my sweet, think of me now and then.
God-speed, my love, 'til you are mine again.

SOMEWHERE OUT THERE
Somewhere out there, beneath the pale moon light
Someone's thinking of me, and loving me tonight
Somewhere out there, someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another, in that big somewhere out there
	And even though I know how very far apart we are
	It helps to think we might be wishing, on the same bright star
	And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
	It helps to think we're sleeping, underneath the same big sky
Somewhere out there, if love can see us through
Then we'll be together, somewhere out there, out where dreams come true

SO MUCH IN LOVE
As we stroll along together, holding hands, walking all alone
So in love are we two that we don't know what to do
So in love, in a world of our own

As we stroll by the sea  together, under stars, twinkling high above
So in love are we two, no one else but me and you
So in love, so much in love, so in love, so much in love
	We stroll along together, I tell you I need you oh so much
	I love, love you my darling, can you tell it in my touch?
When we walk down the aisle together, we will vow to be together till we die
So much love have we two, just can't wait to say "I do"
So in love are you and I, so in love are you and I

SONG FOR A WINTER'S NIGHT
The lamp is burning low upon my table top, the snow is softly falling
The air is still in the silence of my room,  I hear your voice softly calling
	If I could only have you near, to breathe a sigh or two
	I would be happy just to hold the hands I love on this winter night with you
The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead, my glass is almost empty
I read again between the lines upon each page the words of love you sent me
	If I could know within my heart that you were lonely too
	I would be happy just to hold the hands I love on this winter night with you
The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim, the shades of night are lifting
The morning light steals across my window pane, where webs of snow are drifting
	If I could only have you near to breathe a sigh or two
	I would be happy just to hold the hands I love upon this winter night with you
	And to be once again with you

A SONG FOR YOU
I've been so many places in my life and times
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life in stages, with ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now, and I'm singin' this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly, but, darling, can't you see
There's no one more important to me, darling, can't you please see through me
'Cause we're alone now, and I'm singin' this song for you
	You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholding nothin'
	You came out in front, and I was hiding,
	But now I'm so much better, and if my words don't come together
	Listen to the melody, 'cause my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone, and I was singin' this song for you

THE SONG IS YOU
I hear music when I look at you, a beautiful theme of every dream I ever knew
Down deep in my heart I hear it play, I can feel it start, then it melts away

I hear music when I touch your hand, a beautiful melody from some enchanted land
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say, "Is this the day?"
     I alone have heard this lovely strain. I alone have heard this glad refrain
     Must it be forever inside of me? Why can't I let it go? Why can't I let you know?
Why can't I let you know the song my heart would sing?
Beautiful rhapsody of love and youth and spring
The music is sweet, and the words are true, the song is you

Why can't I let you know the song my heart would sing?
That beautiful rhapsody of love and youth and spring
The music is sweet, and the words are true, the song is you

SONGMAN
  Chorus:
     Songman, sing your song until the morning comes, I can listen as long as you can play
     Songman, can you teach me how to make someone feel good?
     I think I'll have a song or two that I might wanna sing like you someday
When I was young, he'd come around from time to time, he could really make that old piano ring
I remember how my daddy smiled a certain kind of smile
With every song his little friend would sing
	("Songman....)
He'd sit there in the parlor, with a twinkle in his eye, laughing as he had a taste or two
Then all of us would gather 'round, and listen in, as he'd play us every song he ever knew

He'd sing of old times and simple rhymes, he'd sing of ladies fair, one song always made my mama cry
With every tune, he filled the room with cowboys, clowns or kings
You could almost touch them if you tried        ("Songman....)
            I often wondered, was he happy all the time, or did he just play the part
           Why he came alone, and why he always left the same, did he sing to hide a broken heart?
Those days are gone forever, but some things remain the same
Though he and his songs have both gone out of style
Beneath it all, no matter what you think you see, I'm just a songman tryin' to make you smile
     Songman, sing your song until the morning comes, I can listen as long as you can play
     Songman, can you teach me how to make someone feel good?
     I think I'll have a song or two that I might wanna sing like you.....someday

SONGS MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME/ALS DIE MUTTER SANG
Songs my mother taught me, in the days long vanished;
Seldom from her eyelids were the teardrops banished.
Now I teach my children, each melodious measure.
Oft the tears are flowing, oft they flow from my memory's treasure.

Als die alte Mutter mich noch lehrte singen,
Tränen in den Wimpern gar so oft ihr hingen.
Jetzt, wo ich die Kleinen selber üb im Sange,
Rieselt's in den Bart oft, rieselt's oft von der braunen Wange.

SONG SUNG BLUE
Song sung blue, everybody knows one, song sung blue, every garden grows one
Me and you are subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song, you sing them out again, sing them out again

Song sung blue, weepin' like a willow, song sung blue, sleepin' on my pillow
Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know it, start to feelin' good, you've simply got no choice, simply got no choice

SONNY BOY
	Climb up on my knee, Sonny Boy. Though you're only three, Sonny Boy,
	You've no way of knowing, there's no way of showing
	What you mean to me, Sonny Boy
When there are gray skies, I don't mind the gray skies, you make them blue, Sonny Boy
Friends may forsake me, let 'em all forsake me, I still have you, Sonny Boy
	You're sent from heaven and I know your worth
	You've made a heaven for me right here on earth
When I'm old and gray, dear, promise you won't stray dear, I love you so, Sonny Boy
When there are gray skies, I don't mind the gray skies, you make them blue, Sonny Boy
Friends may forsake me, let 'em all forsake me, I still have you, Sonny Boy
	You're sent from heaven and I know your worth
	You've made a heaven for me right here on earth
And the angels grew lonely, took you 'cause they're lonely
Now I'm lonely too, Sonny Boy

SOON IT'S GONNA RAIN
Hear how the wind begins to whisper, see how the leaves go streaming by
Smell how the velvet rain is falling, out where the fields are warm and dry
Now is the time to run inside and stay
Now is the time to find a hideaway, where we can play

Soon it's gonna rain, I can see it, soon it's gonna rain, I can tell
Soon it's gonna rain, what are we gonna do?
Soon it's gonna rain, I can feel it, soon it's gonna rain, I can tell
Soon it's gonna rain, what will we do with you?

We'll find four limbs of a tree, we'll build four walls and a floor
We'll bind it over with leaves, then duck inside and play
Then we'll let it rain, we'll not feel it, then we'll let it rain, rain pall mall
And we'll not complain if it never stops at all
We'll live and love within our own four walls

SORRY  (I RAN ALL THE WAY HOME)
	Sorry, sorry, oh, so sorry....uh oh!
I ran all the way home, just to say I'm sorry.
What can I say,  I ran all the way, yay, yay, yay
I ran all the way home, just to say I'm sorry.
Please let me say, I ran all the way, yay, yay, yay  (yay, yay, yay)
	And now I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to make you cry
	Let's make amends, after all, we're more than friends, yay, yay, yay
I ran all the way home, just to say I'm sorry.
What can I say, I ran all the way, yay, yay, yay

MY HEART IS AN OPEN BOOK
	Don't believe all those lies,  darlin', just believe your eyes and
Look, look, my heart is an open book. I love nobody but you
Look, look, my heart is an open book. My love is honest and true
     Some jealous so-and-so wants us to part
     That's why he's tellin' you that I've got a cheatin' heart
	Don't believe all those lies,  darlin', just be-lieve your eyes and
Look, look, my heart is an open book. I love nobody but you,
Nobody but you, no....body....but....you

SO SAD
We used to have good times together, but now I feel them slip away
It makes me cry to see love die, so sad to watch good love go bad

Remember how you used to feel, dear? You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart to see us part. So sad to watch good love go bad
       Is it any wonder that I feel so blue,  when I know for certain that I'm losing you
Remember how you used to feel dear? You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart to see us part. So sad to watch good love go bad
So sad to watch good love go bad

THE SOUND OF MUSIC
	My day in the hills has come to an end, I know
	A star has come out to tell me it's time to go
	But deep in the dark green shadows are voices that urge me to stay
	So, I pause, and I wait, and I listen for one more sound
	For one more lovely thing that the hills might  say
The  hills are alive with the sound of music,
With songs they have sung for a thousand years.
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music.
My heart wants to sing every song it hears.
         My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds that rise from the lake to the trees.
         My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies from a church on a breeze,
         To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over stones on its way,
         To sing through the night, like a lark who is learning to pray.
I  go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I've heard be-fore.
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music, and I'll sing once more.
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music, and I'll sing once more.

SOUTHERN NIGHTS
Southern nights, have you ever felt a southern night
Free as a breeze, not to mention the trees
Whistling tunes that you know and love so
Southern nights, just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize to anyone who can truly say that he has found a better way

Southern skies, have you ever noticed Southern skies
Well, its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes running through the soul, like the stories told of old
Old man, he and his dog that walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand, as he slowly walked by
Weeping willows would cry for joy.....joy

Feels so good, feels so good it's frightening
Wish I could stop this world from fighting
La-da-da-da-da, da-la-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
Mystery, like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night, in the southern skies

Southern nights, they feel so good it's frightening
Wish I could stop this world from fighting
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da...

SOUTH OF THE BORDER
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay   (X2)
South of  the  border, down Mexico way,
That's where I fell in love, when the stars above came out to play.
And now as I wander,  my thoughts ever  stray, south of the border, down Mexico  way.

She was a picture in old Spanish lace, and, for a tender while, I  kissed a smile upon her face.
For it was fiesta  and we were so gay, south of the border, down Mexico  way.
	Then she sighed as she whispered, "manana", never dreaming that we  were parting,
	And I lied as  I whispered, "manana",  for our tomorrow never came.
South of the border, I rode back one day,
There in a veil of white, by the candle-light, she knelt to pray.
The mission bells told me,  that I  mustn't stay, south of the border, down Mexico  way.
The mission bells told me,  that I  mustn't stay, south of the border, down Mexico  way.
     Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay

SPANISH EYES
Blue Spanish eyes, teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes
Please, please don't cry, this is just adios, and not good-bye
	Soon I'll return, bringing you all the love your heart can hold
	Please say, "Si, si," say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
Blue Spanish eyes, prettiest eyes in all of Mexico
True Spanish eyes, please smile for me once more, before I go
	Soon I'll return, bringing you all the love your heart can hold
	Please say, "Si, si," say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
	Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me

SPANISH HARLEM
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem, a red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run, and all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street,  right up through the concrete, but soft and sweet and dreaming
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem, a red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal, that looks down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control, I have to beg your pardon
I'm goin' to pick that rose and watch her as she grows in my garden

SPANISH IS THE  LOVING TONGUE
Spanish is the lovin' tongue, soft as music, light as spray
'Twas a girl I learned it from, livin' down Sonora way
I don't look much like a lover, but I say her love words over
Often when I'm all alone, "mi amor, mi corazon."

Nights when she knew that I'd ride, she would listen for my spurs
Throw that big door open wide, raise them laughin' eyes of hers
How my heart would nigh stop beatin', when I'd hear her tender greetin'
Whispered soft, for me alone, " mi amor, mi corazon."

Never seen her since that night, I can't cross the line, you know
Wanted for a gamblin' fight, like as not, it's better so
Still I often sort of miss her, since that last sad night I kissed her
Left her heart and lost my own, "adios, mi corazon."

SPEAK LOW
Speak low when you speak, love, our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak, love, our moment is swift, like ships adrift, we're swept apart, too soon

Speak low, darling, speak low, love is a spark, lost in the dark too soon, too soon
I feel wherever I go, that tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here and always too soon
	Time is so old and love so brief, love is pure gold and time a thief
We're late, darling, we're late, the curtain descends, everything ends too soon, too soon
I wait, darling, I wait, will you speak low to me, speak love to me and soon
	Time is so old and love so brief, love is pure gold and time a thief
We're late, darling, we're late, the curtain descends, everything ends too soon, too soon
I wait, darling, I wait, will you speak low to me, speak love to me and soon
Speak low

SPLISH SPLASH
Splish Splash, I was takin' a bath, long about a Saturday night, yeah
Rub-a-dub, just relaxin' in the tub, thinkin' everything was alright
Well, I stepped out the tub, put my feet on the floor,
I wrapped the towel around me, and I opened the door, and then
Splish, Splash! I jumped back in the bath, well how was I to know there was a party going on
	They was a-splishin' and a-splashin', reelin' with the feelin',
	Moving and a-groovin, rockin' and a-rollin', yeah!
Bing bang, I saw the whole gang, dancing on my living room rug, yeah!
Flip flop, they was doing the bop, all the teens had the dancin' bug
There was lollipop with-a Peggy Sue, Good Golly, Miss Molly was-a even there, too!
A-well-a, Splish Splash, I forgot about the bath, I went and put my dancin shoes on, yay...
	I was a rollin' and a strollin', reelin' with the feelin',
	Movin and a groovin', splishin' and a splashin, yeah!
Yes, I was a-splishin' and a splashin', I was a-rollin' and a-strollin'
Yeah, I was a-movin' and a-groovin'...woo! We was a-reelin' with the feelin'..ha!
We was a-rollin' and a-strollin', movin with the groovin', splish splash, yeah!

Yes, I was a-splishin' and a splashin', I was a-rollin' and a-strollin'
Yeah, I was a-movin' and a-groovin'...woo! We was a-reelin' with the feelin'..ha!
We was a-rollin' and a-strollin', movin with the groovin',
A-reelin' with the feelin', splishin' and a-splashin', SPLISH SPLASH! SPLISH SPLASH!

SPOOKY
In the cool of the evening when everything is gettin' kind of groovy,
I call you up and ask you if you'd like to go with me and see a movie,
First you say no, you've got some plans for the night,
And then you stop, and say, "Alright."
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you.
You always keep me guessin', I never seem to know what you are thinkin'.
And if a fella looks at you, it's for sure your little eye will be a-winkin'.
I get confused, 'cause I don't know where I stand,
	And then you smile, and hold my hand.
	Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you. Spooky!
If you decide someday to stop this little game that you are playin',
I'm gonna tell you all what's in my heart that's been a-dyin' to be sayin'
Just like a ghost, you've been a-hauntin' my dreams,
So I'll propose... on Halloween.
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you, Spooky,
Spooky, all right, I said Spooky!

A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR
In every job that must be done there is an element of fun
You find the fun and snap! The job's a game
In every task you undertake, becomes a piece of cake
A lark! A spree! It's very clear to see
     That a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down,
     The medicine go down, the medicine go down
     Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in a most delightful way
A robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest,
While gathering his bits of twine and twig
Though quite intent in his pursuit, he has a merry tune to toot
He knows a song will move the job along
     For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down,
     The medicine go down, the medicine go down
     Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down, in a most delightful way

S'POSIN'
	I know something, but I can't express it, though there is no better time than now
	I have waited, hoping you would guess it, got to make my feelings known somehow
S'posin' I should fall in love with you, do you think that you could love me too
S'posin' I should hold you and caress you, would it impress you, or distress you
S'posin' I should say "for you I yearn," would you think I'm speaking out of turn
And s'posin I'd declare it, would you take my love and share it?
I'm not s'posin', I'm in love with you.

SPREAD A LITTLE HAPPINESS
Even when the darkest clouds are in the sky, you mustn't sigh and you mustn't cry
Spread a little happiness as you go by, please try
What's the use of worrying and feeling blue, when days are long keep on smiling through
Spread a little happiness till dreams come true
	Surely you'll be wise to make the best of every blues day
	Don't you realize you'll find next Monday or next Tuesday your golden shoes day
Even when the darkest clouds are in the sky, you mustn't sigh and you mustn't cry
Spread a little happiness as you go by
	I've got a creed for every need, so easy that it must succeed,
	I'll set it down for you to read, so please, take heed
	Keep out the gloom, let in the sun, that's my advice for everyone.
	It's only once we pass this way, so day by day
Even when the darkest clouds are in the sky, you mustn't sigh and you mustn't cry
Spread a little happiness as you go by, spread a little happiness as you go by

SPREAD IT AROUND
If you woke up this morning on the right side of the bed,
That's a good feeling spread it around
If you can't keep from laughin' at somethin' someone says
That's a good sayin', spread it around
	You'll find that happiness grows if you let it
	Feels good the farther it goes, so go spread it
If you found the way to make sunshine, the whole world should know
Tell 'em about it, spread it around

Give your hand to somebody, and help him when he's down
Tell him some good news, spread it around
Sing a little song with kindness, love is a happy sound
Stand up and shout it, spread it around
	You'll find that happiness grows if you let it
	Feels good the farther it goes, so go spread it
If you found the way to make sunshine, the whole world should know
Tell 'em about it, spread it around
	I said tell 'em about it, spread it around....spread it around

SPRING CAN REALLY HANG YOU UP THE MOST
	Once I was a sentimental thing, threw my heart away each spring
	Now a spring romance hasn't got a chance, promised my first dance to winter
	All I've got to show's a splinter for my little fling
Spring this year has got me feeling like a horse that never left the post
I lie in my room, staring up at the ceiling, spring can really hang you up the most
Morning's kiss wakes trees and flowers, and to them I'd like to drink a toast
I walk in the park, just to kill lonely hours, spring can really hang you up the most
	All afternoon, those birds twitter-twit, I know the tune: "This is love, this is it!"
	Heard it before and I know the score, and I've decided that spring is a bore!
Love seemed sure around the New Year, now it's April, love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time, only what became of you, dear, spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here, there's no mistaking, robins building nests from coast to coast
My heart tries to sing, so they won't hear it breaking, spring can really hang you up the most
College boys are writing sonnets, in the tender passion they're engrossed
But I'm on the shelf, with last year's Easter bonnets, spring can really hang you up the most
	Love came my way, I hoped it would last, we had our day, now it's all in the past
	Spring came along, a season of song, full of sweet promise, but something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic: sulphur and mollasses was the dose
Didn't help a bit, my condition must be chronic, spring can really hang you up the most
All alone, the party's over, old man winter was a  gracious host
But when you keep praying for snow to hid the clover, spring can really hang you up the most

STAND BY ME
When the night has come, and the land is dark, and the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid, oh, I won't be afraid, just as long as you stand, stand by me
     So, darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh, stand by me, oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me
If the sky, that we look upon, should tumble and fall, or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no, I won't shed a tear, just as long as you stand, stand by me
    And, darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh, stand by me, whoa, stand now, stand by me, stand by me

     So, darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh, stand by me, oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me
     Whenever you're in trouble, won't you stand by me, oh, stand by me
     Oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me

STARDUST
And now the purple dusk of twilight time steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb, always reminding me that we're apart
You wandered down the lane and far away, leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the Star Dust of yesterday, the music of the years gone by.

Sometimes I wonder why I spend the lonely nights dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie, and I am once again with you
When our love was new, and each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago, now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
Beside a garden wall when stars are bright you are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale of paradise where roses grew
Though I dream in vain, in my heart it will remain
My stardust melody, the memory of love's refrain

THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER
Oh say can you see by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
Oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

STARS FELL ON ALABAMA
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamour, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
	I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
	A fairy land where no one else could enter, and in the center just you and me
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

STARWOOD IN ASPEN
It's a long way from L.A. to Denver, a long time to hang in the sky,
A long way home to Starwood in Aspen,
A sweet Rocky Mountain paradise, oh, my sweet Rocky Mountain paradise.
     
Springtime is rollin' 'round slowly, gray skies are bringin' me down.
I can't remember when I've ever been so lonely,
I forgot what it's like to be home, can't remember what it's like to be home.
     
I think on my lady's sweet memories, I think on my children's sweet smiles.
I think on my home in Starwood in Aspen,
All my friends and the snow-covered hills. Oh, my friends are the snow covered hills.
       
And I tell you I'm happy to be here, to share and consider this time,
For I see here the shadows of changes,
And a feeling of new friends to find. And I see here some new friends to find. 

It's a long way from this place to Denver, it's a long time to hang in the sky.
A long way home to Starwood in Aspen,
A sweet Rocky Mountain paradise, oh, my sweet Rocky Mountain paradise.

STEWBALL WAS A RACEHORSE
Old Stewball was a racehorse, and I wish he were mine
He never drank water, he always drank wine
	His bridle was silver, and his mane it was gold
	And the worth of his saddle has never been told
Oh the fairgrounds were crowded, and Stewball was there
But the betting was heavy on the bay and the mare
	And away up yonder, ahead of them all
	Came a-prancing and a-dancing, my noble Stewball
I bet on the gray mare, I bet on the bay
If I'd bet on old Stewball, I'd be a free man today
	Oh the hoot owl she hollers, and the turtle dove moans
	I'm a poor boy in trouble. I'm a long way from home
Old Stewball was a racehorse, and I wish he were mine
He never drank water, he always drank wine

STOMPIN' AT THE SAVOY
Savoy, the home of sweet romance; Savoy, it wins you with a glance
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance
Your form, just like a clingin' vine, your lips, so warm and sweet as wine
Your cheek, so soft and close to mine, divine.
	How my heart is singin' while the band is swingin'
	Never tired of rompin' and stompin' with you at the Savoy
What joy! A perfect holiday! Savoy, where we can glide and sway
Savoy, there let me stomp away with you.

STOP IN THE NAME OF LOVE
	Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart
Baby, baby, I'm aware of where you go, each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street, knowing your other love you meet
But this time, before you run to her, leaving me alone and hurt
(Think it over) after I've been good to you. (Think it over) after I've been sweet to you.
	Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart  (X2)
	Think it over. Think it over.
I've known of your, your secluded nights, I've even seen her, maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression worth more than my love and affection
This time, before you leave my arms, and rush of to her charms,
(Think it over) haven't I been good to you. (Think it over) haven't I been sweet to you.
	Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart  (X2)
	Think it over. Think it over.
I've tried so hard, hard to be patient, hoping you'd stop this infatuation
But each time you are together, I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever
	Stop! In the name of love, before you break my heart  (X2)   STOP!

STORMY
You were the sunshine, baby, whenever you smiled, but I call you Stormy today
All of a sudden that old rain's comin' down, and my world is cloudy and gray. You went away!
	Stormy, oh, Stormy, bring back that sunny day.
Yesterday's love was like a warm, summer breeze, but, like the weather, it changed
Now things are dreary, baby, and it's windy and cold
And I stand alone in the rain....calling your name
	Stormy, oh, Stormy, bring back that sunny day.

STORMY WEATHER
Don't know why, there's no sun up in the sky, stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together, keeps raining all the time
Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere, stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together
I'm weary all the time, the time, so weary all of the time
	When she went away, the blues walked in and met me
	If she stays away, old rocking chair will get me
	All I do is pray the lord above will let me walk in the sun once more
Can't go on, everything I had is gone, stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together, keeps raining all the time, keeps raining all of the time

THE STORY BOOK BALL
In Mother Goose's book up in the nurs'ry,
Poor Simple Simon said, "I'm feeling sad."
Said Peter Piper's daughter, "So am I, and think we oughter
Try to think of something that will make us glad."
So Smarty Smarty said, "I'll give a party,"
And they called on the Old Woman in the Shoe.
The cat she brought her fiddle, and she played "high diddle diddle,"
And what happened then, I'm goin' to tell to you.

Little Jackie Horner, eating pie up in the corner,
Stuck in his thumb, pulled out a plum.
Little Missy Muffet she was sitting on a tuffet,
And said, "Yum, yum! Please give me some."

Little Georgie Porgie with his pudding and pie,
Kissed Mary Quite Con-trary till he made her cry;
And Little Bo Peep she lost her sheep
And couldn't find 'em,  their tails be-hind 'em.

Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater had a wife and couldn't keep her.
At the ball,   in the hall.
Humpty Dumpty met her, said, "Better that I get her
And I'll make her fall."     That's not all.
Old King Cole, that merry old soul,
He fell for Mother Hubbard, blew his big bankroll
Buying lollipops and pretties for the kiddies at the Story Book Ball.

They sang and danced till early in the morning.
They really didn't know just when to stop;
So as the day was dawning and the kiddies all were yawning,
They found out the mouse had run up in the clock.
Then Jack Be Nimble, Jack Be Quick, he started,
And right over that big candlestick he flew.
Then Little Tommy Tucker started singing for his supper,
And then Poor Boy Blue said, "Gee, I'm hungry too."

Peter Piper picked a peck of pickling peppers,
Brought 'em to the hall, and that's no stall.
Tommy Tom the piper's son, he stole a pig and away he run
To the ball. And that's not all.

Polly put the kettle on. The tea got cold.
They had to eat the porridge that was nine days old.
Then Jack fell down. Jill broke her crown
And spilled the water. She hadn't oughter.

Four and twenty blackbirds were baking in a pie,
And they re-fused to sing any-thing.
Wasn't that an awful way for little birds to act
Before a queen and king?    Such a thing!
Said the knave and the king to the Queen of Hearts,
"Come on. Hurry up, honey. Bring some tarts."
So they did and the kids had a picnic at the Story Book Ball.

THE STORY OF A STARRY NIGHT
This is the story of a starry night, the faded glory of a new de-light
One breathless meeting,  two lips repeating
Three precious words that were sweet but fleeting
When stars are bright my heart keeps wondering why
Our first "good-night" became our last goodbye
I pray that some day love will in some way
Bring back the story of a starry night    (repeat last 2 lines)

THE STORY OF A STARRY NIGHT  MEDLEY  (4 SONGS)
This is the story of a starry night, the faded glory of a new de-light
One breathless meeting,  two lips repeating
Three precious words that were sweet but fleeting
When stars are bright my heart keeps wondering why
Our first "good-night" became our last goodbye
I pray that some day love will in some way
Bring back the story of a starry night    (repeat last 2 lines)

FIRE AND RAIN
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Susanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to.
	I've seen fire and I've seen rain, I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
	I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend. But I always thought that I'd see you again
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus, you gotta help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand. I won't make it any other way
	I've seen fire......
Been walkin' my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
	I've seen fire......

HOME SWEET HOME
'Mid pleasures and palaces, though we may roam
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home
A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there
Which seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere.
Home, home, sweet, sweet home, there's no place like home

LET IT BE
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary Comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, Let it Be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, Let it Be
	Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeh, let it be,  whisper words of wisdom, Let It Be
And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.
	Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeh, let it be,  there will be an answer, Let It Be
And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
	Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeh, let it be, whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

STRAIGHTEN UP AND FLY RIGHT
A buzzard took a monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that everything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off  his back
But the monkey grabbed his neck and said now listen,  Jack
	Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and fly right
	Straighten up and fly right,  cool down papa don't you blow your top
	Ain't no use in diving, what's the use of jiving
	Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa don't you blow  your   top
The buzzard told the monkey you are choking me
Release your hold and I will set you free
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye
And said your story's so touching, but it's sounds just like a lie
         Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and stay right
         Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa don't you blow your top
         Ain't no use in diving, what's the use of jiving
         Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa don't you blow  your

STRANGER IN PARADISE
Take my hand, I'm a stranger in paradise, all lost in a wonderland, a stranger in paradise.
If I stand starry-eyed that's a danger in paradise, for mortals who stand beside an angel like you.
	I saw your face and I  ascended, out of the common place into the rare.
	Somewhere in space I hang suspended, until I know there's a chance that you care.
Won't you answer this fervent prayer of a stranger in paradise?
Don't send me in dark despair for all that I hunger for.
But open your angel's arms to the stranger in paradise,
And tell him that he need be a stranger no more. And tell him that he need be a stranger no more.

STRANGER ON THE SHORE
Here I stand, watching the tide go out
So all alone and blue, just dreaming dreams of you

I watched your ship as it sailed out to sea
Taking all my dreams, and taking all of me
	The sighing of the waves, the wailing of the wind
	The tears in my eyes burn, pleading, "My love, return!"
Why, oh, why must I go on like this?
Shall I just be a lonely stranger on the shore?

	The sighing of the waves, the wailing of the wind
	The tears in my eyes burn, pleading, "My love, return!"
Why, oh, why must I go on like this?
Shall I just be a lonely stranger on the shore?

STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT
Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wond'ring in the night what were the chances
We'd be sharing love before the night was through
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in you smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you
	Strangers in the night, two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
	Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
	Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

STREETS OF LAREDO
As I walked out in the streets of Laredo,  as I walked out in Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy wrapped all in white linen, wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay
    Oh, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly, sing the dead march as you carry me along
    Take me to the valley, there lay the sod o'er me, I'm a young cowboy and know I've done wrong
I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy, these words he did say as I boldly walked by
Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story, got shot in the breast and I know I must die
    Go fetch me some water a cool cup of water, to cool my parched lips then the poor cowboy said
    Before I returned his spirit had left him, had gone to his maker the cowboy was dead
Oh, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly, sing the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the valley, there lay the sod o'er me, I'm a young cowboy and know I've done wrong

STREETS OF LONDON
Have you seen the old man, in the closed-down market, kicking up the paper, with his worn-out shoes?
In his eyes you see no pride, and held loosely at his side, yesterday's paper, telling yesterday's news
	So how can you tell me, you're lonely, and say for you that the sun don't shine?
	Let me take you by the hand, and lead you through the streets of London
	I'll show you something, to make you change your mind
Have you seen the old girl, who walks the streets of London, dirt in her hair, and her clothes in rags?
She's no time for talkin', she just keeps right on walkin', carryin' her home, in two carrier bags
In the all-night cafe,  at a quarter past eleven, same old man, sitting there on his own
Lookin' at the world, over the rim of his tea-cup, each tea lasts an hour, and he wanders home alone

And have you seen the old man, outside the seaman's mission?
His memory's fading, with the medal ribbons that he wears
And in our winter city, the rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero, and a world that doesn't care
	How can you tell me, you're lonely, and say for you that the sun don't shine?
	Let me take you by the hand, and lead you through the streets of London
	I'll show you something, to make you change your mind
	I'll show you something, to make you change your mind

STRIKE UP THE BAND
Let the drums roll out, let the trumpet call, while the people shout, strike up the band!
Hear the cymbals ring, calling one and all, to the martial swing, strike up the band!
There is work to be done, to be done, there's a war to be won, to be won,
Come, you son of a gun, of a gun, take your stand!
Fall in line, yea bo! Come along, let's go! Hey, leader, strike up the band

STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU
Well I don't know why I came here tonight, I got the feelin' that somethin' ain't right,
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair, and I'm wonderin' how I'll get down the stairs,
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, here I am,  stuck in the middle with you.

Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you, and I'm wonderin' what it is I should do,
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face, losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place,
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, here I am,  stuck in the middle with you.
      Well you started off with nothin', and you're proud that you're a self made man,
      And your friends, they all come crawlin', slap you on the back and say, please.... please.....
Trying to make some sense of it all, but I can see that it makes no sense at all,
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor, 'cause I don't think that I can take anymore
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, here I am,  stuck in the middle with you.
       Well you started off with nothin', and you're proud that you're a self made man,
       And your friends, they all come crawlin', slap you on the back and say, please.... please.....
Well I don't know why I came here tonight, I got the feeling that somethin' ain't right,
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair, and I'm wonderin' how I'll get down the stairs,
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, here I am,  stuck in the middle with you.
    Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you, stuck in the middle with you,
    Here I am, stuck in the middle with you!

STUCK ON YOU
You can shake an apple off an apple tree, shake-a, shake-sugar, but you'll never shake me
Uh-uh-uh, no-sir-ee, uh, uh.
I'm gonna stick like glue, stick-because I'm stuck on you

I'm gonna run my fingers through your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear, uh-uh-uh, yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue, stick-because I'm stuck on you
	Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall, ain't gonna do you no good at all
	'Cause once I catch ya and the kissin' starts, a team o' wild horses couldn't tear us apart
Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side, that's how love is gonna keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, oh yeah, uh-uh-uh
I'm gonna stick like glue, stick-because I'm stuck on you
	Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall, ain't gonna do you no good at all

Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side, that's how love is gonna keep us tied

I'm gonna stick like glue, yeah yeah, because I'm stuck on you
I'm gonna stick like glue, yeah yeah, because I'm stuck on you

STUMBLING
Verse 1: 'Tention folks, speak of jokes, this is one on me,
Took my gal to a dance, at the Armory,
Music played, dancer swayed, then we joined the crowd;
I can't dance, took a chance, and right then we started:
	Stumbling all around, stumbling all around, stumbling all around so funny,
	Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere, and I must declare,
	I stepped right on her toes, and when she bumped my nose,
	I  fell and when I rose, I felt a-shamed, and told    her,
	That's the latest step, that's the latest step,  that's the latest step, my honey
	Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep;
	She said, "Stop mumbling, tho' you are stumbling,
	I  like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit.
Verse 2:  Young and small short and tall, folks most ev'rywhere,
Take a chance do this dance, they think it's a bear,
People rave, and they crave, just to do this step,
Off they go, nice and slow, when the band starts playing....(Stumbling....)


STUPID CUPID
Stupid Cupid you're a real mean guy, I'd like to clip your wings so you can't fly
I'm in love and it's a crying shame, and I know that you're the one to blame
Hey, hey, set me free, stupid cupid, stop picking on me

I can't do my homework and I can't think straight,
I meet her/him every morning 'bout half past eight
I'm acting like a lovesick fool, you've even got me carrying her/his books to school
Hey, hey, set me free, stupid cupid, stop picking on me
	You mixed me up, but good, right from the very start
	Hey, go play Robin Hood with somebody else's heart
You got me jumping like a crazy clown, and I don't feature what you're putting down
Since I kissed her/his loving lips of wine, the thing that bothers me is that I like it fine
Hey, hey, set me free, stupid cupid, stop picking on me

SUBWAY SONG (BOSTON)
Now you've all been to Boston on the subway, time to time
But have you ever noticed how the stations fall in line
Just take the first initial of each stop you hear them yell
And you will have a word which will describe old Boston well

H is for my alma mater Hah-vahd, C for Central Station, next in line,
K is then for Kendall's cozy corner, C for Charles Street Station, o'er the brine...
P is then Pahk, the busy city, W for Washington you see...
Put them all together they spell... (HCCKKCC... PW... (sounds like somebody spitting))
That's just about what Boston means to me!

SUGAR SUGAR
     Sugar, ah Honey Honey, you are my candy girl, and you've got me wanting you
     Honey, ah Sugar Sugar, you are my candy girl, and you've got me wanting you
I just can't believe the loveliness of loving you (I just can't believe it's true)
I just can't believe the one to love this feeling to (I just can't believe it's true)
     Ah, Sugar, ah, Honey Honey, you are my candy girl, and you've got me wanting you
     Ah, Honey, ah Sugar Sugar, you are my candy girl, and you've got me wanting you
When I kissed you, girl, I knew how sweet a kiss could be (I know how sweet a kiss can be)
Like the summer sunshine, pour your sweetness over me (Pour your sweetness over me)
	Oh, oh, oh, pour a little Sugar on it, Honey
	Pour a little Sugar on it, baby
	You're gonna make my life so sweet, yeah yeah yeah
	Pour a little Sugar on it, oh yeah
     Sugar, ah Honey Honey, you are my candy girl, and you've got me wanting you
     Oh, Honey, ah Sugar Sugar, you are my candy girl, and you've got me wanting you

SUGARTIME
Sugar in the mornin', sugar in the evenin', sugar at supper time.
Be my little sugar and love me all the time.
Honey in the mornin', honey in the evenin', honey at supper time.
Be my little honey and love me all the time.
	Put your arms around me and swear by the stars above
	You'll be mine forever in a heaven of love.
Sugar in the mornin', sugar in the evenin', sugar at supper time.
Be my little sugar and love me all the time.
	Now sugar time is anytime, that your near, or just appear.
	So don't you roam, just be my honeycomb, we'll live in a heaven on love.
Sugar in the mornin'.......

SUGAR TOWN
I got some troubles, but they won't last. I'm gonna lay right down, here in the grass
And, pretty soon all my troubles will pass
	'Cause I'm in shu shu shu, shu, shu shu, shu, shu, shu, shu, shu, shu, Sugar Town
I never had a dog that liked me some. I never had a friend, or wanted one
So I just lay back, and laugh at the sun
	'Cause I'm in shu shu shu, shu, shu shu, shu, shu, shu, shu, shu, shu, Sugar Town
Yesterday it rained in Tennessee. I heard it also rained in Talahassee
But not a drop fell on little old me
	'Cause I'm in shu shu shu, shu, shu shu, shu, shu, shu, shu, shu, shu, Sugar Town
If I had a million dollars, or ten, I'd give it to you, world, and then
You'd go away, and let me spend
	My life in shu shu shu, shu, shu shu, shu, shu, shu, shu, shu, shu, Sugar Town
     La la la......

SUMMER  BREEZE
See the curtains hangin' in the window, in the evening on a Friday night
A little light, a-shinin' through the window, lets me know everything's alright
             Summer breeze, makes me feel fine, blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
             Summer breeze, makes me feel fine, blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
See the paper, layin' on the sidewalk, a little music from the house next door
So, I walk on up to the doorstep, through the screen, and across the floor
             Summer breeze, makes me feel fine, blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
             Summer breeze, makes me feel fine, blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom. July is dressed up, and playing her tune
And, I come home, from a hard day's work, and you're waiting there, not a care in the world
    See the smile, a-waiting in the kitchen, food cooking, and the plates for two
    See the arms that reach out to hold me, in the evening, when the day is through
             Summer breeze, makes me feel fine, blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
             Summer breeze, makes me feel fine, blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

SUMMER IN THE CITY
Hot town, summer in the city, back of my neck gettin' dirty and  gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity? Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around, people lookin' half dead, walkin' on the sidewalk, hotter than a match-head
     But at night it's a different world, go out and find a girl
     Come on, come on, and dance all night, despite the heat, it'll be alright
     And, babe, don't you know it's a pity, that the days can't be like the nights
     In the summer, in the city, in the summer, in the city
Cool town, evening in the city, dressin' so fine, and lookin' so pretty
Cool cat, lookin' for a kitty, gonna look in every corner of the city
Till I'm wheezin' like a bus stop, runnin' up the stairs, gonna meet you on the rooftop
     But at night it's a different world, go out and find a girl
     Come on, come on, and dance all night, despite the heat, it'll be alright
     And, babe, don't you know it's a pity, that the days can't be like the nights
     In the summer, in the city, in the summer, in the city

Hot town, summer in the city, back of my neck gettin' dirty and  gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity? Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around, people lookin' half dead, walkin' on the sidewalk, hotter than a match-head
     But at night it's a different world, go out and find a girl
     Come on, come on, and dance all night, despite the heat, it'll be alright
     And, babe, don't you know it's a pity, that the days can't be like the nights
     In the summer, in the city, in the summer, in the city

A SUMMER PLACE
There's a summer place, where it may rain or storm, yet I'm safe and warm
For, within that summer place, your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care, for it knows
	There are no gloomy skies, when seen through the eyes
	Of those who are blessed with love
And the sweet secret of a summer place, is that it's anywhere, when two people share
All their hopes, all their dreams, all their love

And the sweet secret of a summer place, is that it's anywhere, when two people share
All their hopes, all their dreams, all their love

SUMMER RAIN
Summer rain taps at my window. West wind soft as a sweet dream
My love warm as the sunshine, sittin' here by me, she's here by me

She stepped out of the rainbow, golden hair shinin' like moon glow
Warm lips soft as a soul, sittin' here by me, she's here by me
	All summer long, we spent dancin' in the sand
	And the jukebox kept on playin' Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We sailed into the sunset, drifted home, caught by a gulf stream
Never gave a thought for tomorrow, just let tomorrow be, now, let tomorrow be

She wants to live in the Rockies. She says that's where we'll find peace
Settle down, raise up a family to call our own, yeah, we'll have a home
	All summer long, we spent groovin' in the sand
	Everybody kept on playin' Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
The snow drifts by my window, north wind blowin' like thunder
Our love's burnin' like fire, and she's here by me, yeah, she's here with me
Let tomorrow be

SUMMER SAMBA
Someone to hold me tight, that would be very nice.
Someone to love me right, that would be very nice
Someone to understand each little dream in me.
Someone to take my hand, to be a team with me
	So nice, life would be so nice if one day I'd find
	Someone who would take my hand and samba through life with me
Someone to cling to me, stay with me right or wrong,
Someone to sing to me some little samba song
Someone to take my heart, then give her heart to me
Someone who's ready to give love a start with me
Oh yes, that would be so nice. Should it be you and me, I could see it would be nice.

SUMMER SONG
Trees swayin' in the summer breeze, showin' off their silver leaves, as we walked by
Soft kisses on a summer's day, laughing all our cares away, just you and I
Sweet sleepy warmth of summer nights, gazing at the distant lights in the starry sky
	They say that all good things must end some day, autumn leaves must fall
	But don't you know that it hurts me so to say goodbye to you
	Wish you didn't have to go, no, no, no, no
And when the rain beats against my window pane
I'll think of summer days again, and dream of you   ("They say...")

SUMMERTIME
Summertime, and the livin' is easy, fish are jumpin', and the cotton is high
Your daddy's rich, and your momma's good lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry
One of these mornings, you're gonna rise up singing
Then you'll spread your wings, and you'll take to the sky
But till that morning, there's a nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mammy standin' by   (X2)

SUMMERTIME BLUES
I'm a-gonna raise a fuss, I'm a-gonna raise a holler
About a-workin' all summer, just to try to earn a dollar
Every time I call my baby, and try to get a date
My boss says, "No dice son, you gotta work late"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well, my mom and pop a-told me, "Son, you gotta make some money"
If you wanna use the car to go a-ridin' next Sunday
Well I didn't go to work, told the boss I was sick
"Well you can't use the car 'cause you didn't work a lick"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

I'm gonna take two weeks, gonna have a fine vacation
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Well I called my congressman and he said, "Whoa!"
"I'd like to help you son but you're too young to vote"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
No, there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

THE SUMMER WIND
The summer wind came blowin' in from across the sea
It lingered there, so warm and fair, to walk with me
All summer long, we sang a song and strolled on golden sand
Two sweethearts and, and the summer wind

Like painted kites those days and nights went flyin' by
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man one day it called to you
And I lost you to.....to the summerwind

The autumn wind and the winter wind have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end
My fickle friend, the summer wind X3

SUNDAY KIND OF LOVE
I  want a Sunday kind of love, a love to last past Saturday night
I'd like to know it's more than love at first sight, I want a Sunday kind of love

I want a love that's on the square, can't seem to find somebody to care
I'm on a lonely road that leads me nowhere, I need a Sunday kind of love
	I do my Sunday dreaming and all my Sunday scheming every minute, every hour, every day.
	I'm hoping to discover a certain kind of lover, who will show me the way.
My arms need someone to enfold, to keep me warm when Mondays are cold.
A love for all my life to have and to hold. I want a Sunday kind of love.

SUNDAY MORNING SUNSHINE
I came into town with a knapsack on my shoulder, and a pocket full of stories that I just had to tell.
You know I've knocked around a bit, I've had my share of small town glories,
And it's time to hit the city and that crazy carousel.
I been feeling sorry for myself, but you know I was only lonely, like everybody else.  Until...
	You brought your Sunday morning sunshine here into my Monday morning rain.
	You taught me happiness just one time, it keeps on coming back again.
These streets were never highways, I had not known the sky above.
These days were never my days, for I had not known your love.
It's funny how a city can put on a different face,
When it holds the one you care for, it becomes a different place.
And I never felt so far from alone. Baby you brought me halfway home.
Oh, baby, you brought me halfway home.
	You brought your Sunday morning sunshine here into my Monday morning rain.
	You taught me happiness just one time, it keeps on coming back again.

SUNDAY WILL NEVER BE THE SAME
I remember Sunday morning, I would greet her at the park
We'd walk together hand in hand, 'til it was almost dark
Now I wake up Sunday morning, walk across the way to find,
Nobody waiting for me, Sunday's just another day
    Sunday will never be the same  (Sunday will never be the same)
    I've lost my Sunday song, she'll not be back again
Sunny afternoons that make me feel so warm inside,
Have turned as cold and gray as ashes, as I feel the embers die

No longer can I walk these paths, for they have changed
I must be on, the sun is gone and I think it's gonna rain
    Sunday will never be the same  (Sunday will never be the same)
    I've lost my Sunday song, she'll not be back a-gain
	    I remember children, feeding flocks of pigeons
	    I remember sunshine, and you were mine
      Sunday will never be the same  (Sunday will never be the same)
      I've lost my Sunday song, she'll not be back a-gain
      Sunday will never be the same     (X3)

SUNDOWN
I can see her lying back in her satin dress in a room where you do what you don't confess
	Sundown, you better take care, if I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
	Sundown, you better take care, if I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
She's been lookin' like a queen in a sailor's dream, and she don't always say what she really means
	Sometimes I think it's a shame, when I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain
	Sometimes I think it's a shame, when I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain
I can picture every move that a man could make, getting' lost in her lovin' is your first mistake
	Sundown, you better take care, if I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
	Sometimes I think it's a sin, when I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again
I can see her looking fast in her faded jeans, she's a hard lovin' woman, got me feelin' mean
	Sometimes I think it's a shame, when I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain
	Sundown, you better take care, if I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
	Sundown, you better take care, if I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
	Sometimes I think it's a sin, when I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again

SUNLIGHT
Have you seen the sunlight pouring through her hair
And felt her warm mouth on you in the summer's air
     Running in a field of brown, laughing, rolling on the ground now, smiling as she pulls you down
     That's the way she feels about you, that's the way she feels about you
If your dreams should wake you, screaming in the night
She can touch your face, and take away your fright
Like a tree in the meadow wind, she will bend to take you in, makes no difference where you been
That's the way she feels about you, that's the way she feels about you, yeah
	If you wake up screaming, scared about what you're dreaming
	You know she is there, she can share, you're aware she cares about you
In the morning, wake up laughing with the day
She will smile, and ask you with her eyes to stay
     Like the sunshine warms the sand, she will touch you with her hand now
     Touching makes you understand,
     That's the way she feels about you, that's the way she feels about you

     Like the sunshine warms the sand, she will touch you with her hand now
     Touching makes you understand, that's the way she feels about you
     That's the way she feels about you, that's the way she feels about you

SUNNY
Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain.
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain.
Now the dark days are done, and the bright days are near,
My Sunny one shines so sincere. Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet.
Sunny, thank you for the love you brought my way.
You gave to me your all and all, and now I feel ten feet tall.
Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, thank you for the truth you let me see.
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to C.
My life was torn like wind-blown sand,
Then a rock was formed when you held hands.
Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face.
Sunny, thank you, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace.
You're my spark of nature's fire, You're my sweet complete desire.
Sunny one so true, yes, I love you.

Sunny, yesterday, oh, my life was filled with rain.
Sunny, you smiled at me and really, really eased the pain.
Now the dark days are done, and the bright days are here,
My Sunny one shines so sincere. Sunny one so true, I love you.
	I love you, I love you, I love you (fade)

SUNNY AFTERNOON
The tax man's taken all my dough, and left me in my stately home, lazing on a sunny afternoon.
And I can't sail my yacht, he's taken everything I've got, all I've got's this sunny afternoon.
     Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze. I got a big fat mama trying to break me.
     And I love to live so pleasantly, live this life of luxury, lazing on a sunny afternoon.
     In the summertime, in the summertime, in the summertime
My girlfriend's run off with my car, and gone back to her ma and pa,
Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty.
Now I'm sitting here, sipping at my ice cold beer, lazing on a sunny afternoon.
     Help me, help me, help me sail away, Well, give me two good reasons why I oughta stay.
     'Cause I love to live so pleasantly, live this life of luxury, lazing on a sunny afternoon.
     In the summertime, in the summertime, in the summertime
Ah, save me, save me, save me from this squeeze. I got a big fat mama trying to break me.
And I love to live so pleasantly, live this life of luxury, lazing on a sunny afternoon.
In the summertime, in the summertime, in the summertime

SUNNY SKIES
Sunny skies sleeps in the morning, he doesn't know when to rise.
He closes his weary eyes upon the day, look at him yawning, throwing his morning hours away.
	He knows how to ease down slowly, everything is fine in the end.
	And you will be pleased to know that sunny skies hasn't a friend.
Sunny skies weeps in the evening, it doesn't much matter why.
I guess he just has to cry from time to time, everyone's leaving, sunny skies has to stay behind.
	Still he knows how to ease down slowly, everything is fine in the end.
	And you will be pleased to know that sunny skies hasn't a friend.
Sunny skies sleeps in the morning, he doesn't know when to rise.
He closes his weary eyes upon the day and throws it all away.

Looking at the snow and trees that grow outside my window, looking at the things that pass me by.
Wondering if where I've been is worth the things I've been through,
Ending with a friend named sunny skies.

SUNRISE, SUNSET
Is this the little girl I carried, is this the little boy at play
I don't remember growing older, when did they?
When did she get to be a beauty, when did he grow to be so tall
Wasn't it yesterday when they were small?

Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset, swiftly fly the days
Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers, blossoming even as we gaze
Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset, swiftly flow the years
One season following another, laden with happiness and tears.

What words of wisdom can I give them, how can I help to ease their way
Now they must learn from one another, day by day
They look so natural together, just like two newlyweds should be
Is there a canopy in store for me.... CHORUS

SUNSHINE
Sunshine, go away today, I don't feel much like dancin'
Some man's gone, and tried to run my life, he don't know what he's askin'
When he tells me I better get in line, I can't hear a word he's sayin'
When I grow up, I'm gonna make him mind, well, these ain't dues I been payin'
	How much does it cost? I'll buy it. The time is all we've lost. I'll try it.
	If he can't even run his own life, I'll be damned if he'll run mine, sunshine
Sunshine, go away today, I don't feel much like dancin'
Some man's gone, and tried to run my life, he don't know what he's askin'
Workin' starts to make me wonder where the fruits of what I do are goin'
He says in love and war all is fair, but he's got cards he ain't showin'
	How much does it cost? I'll buy it. The time is all we've lost. I'll try it.
	If he can't even run his own life, I'll be damned if he'll run mine, sunshine
Sunshine, come back another day, I promise you I'll be singin'
This old world, she's gonna turn around, brand new bells'll  be ringin'

SUNSHINE ON MY SHOULDERS
	 Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy.
	 Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
	 Sunshine on the water  looks so lovely.
	 Sunshine almost always makes me high
If I had a day that I could give you, I'd give to you a day just like today.
If I had a song that I could sing for you, I'd sing  a  song  to  make you feel this way.
             Sunshine on my shoulders..........
If I had a tale that I could tell you, I'd tell a tale that's sure to make you smile.
If I had a wish that I could wish for you, I'd make a wish for sunshine all the while.
	 Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy.
	 Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
	 Sunshine on the water  looks so lovely.
	 Sunshine almost always makes me high. Sunshine almost always........

SUPERWOMAN
Mary wants to be a superwoman, but is that really in her head?
But I just want to live each day to love her for what she is
Mary wants to be another movie star, but is that really in her mind?
And all the things she wants to be, she needs to leave be-hind
	But, very well, I believe I know you very well, wish that you knew me too very well
	And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
	Very well, and I think I can face very well, wish that you knew me too very well
	And I think I can cope with everything going through your head
Mary wants to be a superwoman, and try to boss the bull around
But does she really think that she'll get by with a dream
My woman wants to be a superwoman, and I just had to say good-bye
Because I can't spend all my hours start'n to cry
	But, very well, I believe I know you very well, wish that you knew me too very well
	And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
	Very well, think that I know you too, very well, wish you knew me like I know you
	Very well, and I wish I could think of everything going through your head

SURF CITY

SWANEE
I've been away from you a long time, I never thought I'd miss you so
Somehow, I feel, your love was real, near you I long to be.
The birds are singing, it is songtime, the banjos strumming soft and low
I know that you yearn for me too, Swanee, you're calling me
	Swanee, how I love ya, how I love ya, my dear old Swanee.
	I'd give the world to be among the folks in  D-I-X-I-E-ven know my
	Mammy's waiting for me, praying for me, down by the Swanee.
	The folks up North will see me no more, when I go to that Swanee shore
I love the coolness of the water, I love the softness of the shore
Someday, I know, that I will go homeward, that's where I long to be
The fish are jumping from the river, the birds are graceful, as they soar
I know that they want me today. River, I hear you calling me too.
	Swanee, how I love ya, how I love ya, my dear old Swanee.
	I'd give the world to be among the folks in  D-I-X-I-E-ven know my
	Mammy's waiting for me, praying for me, down by the Swanee.
	The folks up North will see me no more, when I go to that Swanee shore

SWAY
When marimba rhythm starts to play, dance with me, make me sway
Like the lazy ocean hugs the shore, hold me close, sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze, bend with me, sway with me
When you dance you have a way with me, stay with me, sway with me
	Other dancers may be on the floor, dear, but my eyes will see only you
	Only you have that magic technique, when we sway I go weak
I can hear the sound of violins, long before it begins
Make me thrill as well as you know how sway me smooth, sway me now.

SWEET AND LOVELY
Sweet and lovely, sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely, heaven must have sent her my way

Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise?
	When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
	In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody haunting me
Sweet and lovely, sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say

SWEET BABY JAMES
There is a young cowboy who lives on the range. His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons, waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire, thinking about women and bottles of beer
An closing his eyes as the doggies retire, he sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear
	Goodnight, you moonlight ladies, rockabye Sweet Baby James
	Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose, won't you let me go down in my dreams
	And rockabye Sweet Baby James.
Now the first of December was covered with snow, and so was the Turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston.
Lord, the Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go
There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway,
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky; maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me....  CHORUS.

SWEET CAROLINE
Where it began, I can't begin to knowin', but then I know it's growin' strong
Was in the spring, and spring became the summer,
Who'd have believed you'd come along
Hands, touchin' hands, reachin' out, touchin' me,  touchin' you
	Sweet Caroline, good times never seemed so good
	I'd been inclined to believe they never would, but now I
Look at the night and it don't seem so lonely. We fill it up with only two
And when I hurt hurtin' runs off my shoulder. How can I hurt when holding you
Warm, touchin' warm, reachin' out, touchin' me,  touchin' you
	Sweet Caroline, good times never seemed so good
	I'd been inclined to believe they never would,  Oh, no no
	Sweet Caroline, good times never seemed so good
	Sweet Caroline, I believed they never could, Oh,  Caroline

SWEET CITY WOMAN
Well, I'm on my way to the city lights,
To the pretty face that shines her light on the city nights
And I gotta catch a noon train, I gotta be there on time
Oh, it feels so good to know she waits at the end of the line
     Sweet, sweet city woman, I can see your face, I can hear your voice, I can almost touch you
     Sweet, sweet city woman, oh, my banjo and me, we got a feel for singin', yeah, yeah
	Bon, si bon, bon, bon, si bon, bon, bon, si bon, bon, bon, bon, bon  (X2)
	So long, Ma, so long, Pa, so long, neighbors and friends
Like a country morning, all smothered in dew
She's got a way to make a man feel shiny and new
And she'll sing in the evening, old familiar tunes
And she feeds me love and tenderness and macaroons
     Sweet, sweet city woman, I can see your face, I can hear your voice, I can almost touch you
     Sweet, sweet city woman, oh, my banjo and me, we got a feel for singin', yeah, yeah
	Sweet, sweet city woman, oh, my sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet city woman
	Sweet, sweet city woman, oh, my sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet city woman

SWEET DREAMS, SWEETHEART
Good-night, sweet dreams, tomorrow's another day
Till then, sweet dreams, sweetheart
Good-night, sleep tight, I'll see you  along the way
In dreams, sweet dreams, sweetheart
	May angels up above watch over you
	And keep you safe, my love, until the dawn breaks through
Goodnight, sweet dreams, tomorrow's another day
Goodnight, sweet dreams, goodnight, sweet dreams,
Goodnight, sweet dreams, sweetheart

THE SWEETEST SOUNDS
What do I really hear, and what is in the ear of my mind
Which sounds are true and clear, and which will never be defined

The sweetest sounds, I'll ever hear are still inside my head
The kindest words I'll ever know are waiting to be said
The most entrancing sight of all is yet for me to see
And the dearest love in all the world is waiting somewhere for me
Is waiting somewhere, somewhere for me.

SWEET GEORGIA BROWN
No gal made has got a shade on sweet Georgia Brown
Two left feet and oh, so neat is sweet Georgia Brown
They all sigh and want to die for sweet Georgia Brown
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie, not much
It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town
Since she came, why it's a shame how she cools them down
      Fellas she can't get are fellas she ain't met
     Georgia claimed her Georgia named her, sweet Georgia Brown. (repeat 1st four lines)
All those gifts those courters give to sweet Georgia Brown
They buy clothes at fashion shows with one dollar down
Oh, boy, tip your hat. Oh, joy, she's the cat
Who's that, Mister, 'tain't a sister, sweet Georgia Brown
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her, sweet Georgia Brown!

SWEET HAPPY LIFE
My wish for you, sweet happy life
May all the days of the year that you live be laughing days
With all my heart, sweet happy life
And may the night times that follow the day be dancing nights
	Stars for your smile, moons for your hair
	And someone's wonderful love for your loving heart to share
My wish for you, sweet happy life
May all your sorrows be gone and your heart begin to sing
And if a wish can make it be
I wish you spend everyday of your happy life with me
	Stars for your smile, moons for you hair
	And someone's wonderful love for your loving heart to share
Repeat 2nd verse

THE SWEETHEART OF SIGMA CHI
The girl of my dreams is the sweetest girl of all the girls I know
Each sweet co-ed, like a rainbow trail, fades in the afterglow
The blue of her eyes, and the gold of her hair are a blend of the western sky
And the moonlight beams on the girl of my dreams, she's the sweetheart of Sigma Chi

SWEET NOTHIN'S
        Uh huh, honey, alright!

My baby whispers in my ear, mmm, sweet nothin's
She knows the things I like to hear, mmm, sweet nothin's
	Things she wouldn't tell nobody else, secret, baby, I keep 'em to myself
	Sweet nothin's, mmm, sweet nothin's
We walk along, hand in hand, mmm, sweet nothin's
Yeah, we both understand, mmm, sweet nothin's
	Sittin' in the classroom, trying to read my book, my baby give me that special look
	Sweet nothin's, mmm, sweet nothin's
Ah, sittin on my front porch, mmm, sweet nothin's
Well, do I love you? Of course, mmm, sweet nothin's
	Mama turned on the front porch light, sayin',  "Come in darlin', that's enough for tonight"
	Sweet nothin's, mmm, sweet nothin's; sweet nothin's, mmm, sweet nothin's
	Sweet nothin's!

SWEET OLD WORLD
See what you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world
What you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world
The breath from your own lips, the touch of fingertips, a sweet and tender kiss
The sound of a midnight train, wearing someone's ring, someone calling your name
	Somebody so warm cradled in your arm.
	Didn't you think you were worth anything
See what you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world
What you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world

Millions of us in love, promises made good, your own flesh and blood
Looking for some truth, dancing with no shoes, the beat, the rhythm, the blues
	The pounding of your heart's drum, together with another one
	Didn't you think anyone loved you
See what you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world
What you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world

SWEET SEASONS
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and sometimes the blues just get a hold of you
Ah, just when you thought you had made it
All around the block, people will talk, I wanna give it all that I've got
I just don't want, I don't wanna waste it,
	Talkin' 'bout sweet seasons on my mind, sure does appeal to me,
	You know we can get there easily, just like a sailboat sailin' on the sea
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and most times you choose between the two
Ah, wonderin', wonderin' if you have made it
But I'll have some kids, and make my plans, and watch the seasons runnin' away
And I'll build me a life in the open, a life in the country
	Talkin' 'bout sweet seasons on my mind, sure does appeal to me,
	You know we can get there easily, just like a sailboat sailin' on the sea
     Talkin' 'bout a-sweet seasons, talkin' bout a-sweet, sweet, sweet seasons
     Talkin' 'bout a-sweet seasons

SWEETS FOR MY SWEET
	Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey, your perfect kiss thrills me so
	Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey, I'll never ever let you go
If you wanted that star that shines so brightly to match the star dust in your eyes
Darlin', I would chase that bright star nightly, and try to steal it from the skies
	'Cause I would give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
	Your perfect kiss thrills me so
	Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey, I'll never ever let you go
And if you needed a dream to keep you smiling, I'll tell the sandman you were blue
And I'll ask him to keep that sand a-piling, till your dreams would come true
	'Cause I would give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
	Your perfect kiss thrills me so
	Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey, I'll never ever let you go
If you wanted a love to last forever, then I would send my love your way
And my love would not only last forever, but forever and a day
	'Cause I would give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
	Your perfect kiss thrills me so
	Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey, I'll never ever let you go

SWEET SUE-JUST YOU
Every star above knows the one I love, Sweet Sue, just you!
And the moon on high knows the reason why, Sweet Sue,  it's  you!
	No one else,  it seems, ever shares my dreams,
            Without you I don't know what I'd do.
In this heart of mine, you live all the time, Sweet Sue, just you!

SWEET SURRENDER
Lost and alone on some forgotten highway, traveled by many, remembered by few.
Lookin' for somethin' that I can believe in,
Lookin' for somethin' that I'd like to do with my life.

There's nothin' behind me and nothin' that ties me to
Somethin' that might have been true yesterday.
Tomorrow is open and right now it seems to be more than enough to just be here today

And I don't know what the future is holdin' in store,
I don't know where I'm goin', I'm not sure where I've been.
There's a spirit that guides me, a light that shines for me,
My life is worth the livin', I don't need to see the end.
	Sweet, sweet surrender, live, live without care,
	Like a fish in the water, like a bird in the air.
	Sweet, sweet surrender, why don't we live, live without care,
	Like a fish in the water, like a bird in the air.

SWINGING ON A STAR
	Would you like to swing on a star? Carry moonbeams home in a jar?
	And be better off than you are? Or would you rather be a mule?
A mule is an animal with long funny ears, kicks up at anything he hears.
His back is brawny but his brain is weak, he's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak.
And by the way, if you hate to go to school, you may grow up to be a mule.
	Or would you like to swing on a star? Carry moonbeams home in a jar?
	And be better off than you are? Or would you rather be a pig?
A  pig is an animal with dirt on his face; his shoes are a terrible disgrace.
He has no manners when he eats his food, he's fat and lazy and extremely rude;
But if you don't care a feather or a fig, you may grow up to be a pig.
	Or would you like to swing on a star? Carry moonbeams home in a jar?
	And be better off than you are? Or would you rather be a fish?
A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook; he can't write his name or read a book.
To fool the people is his only thought, and though he's slippery, he still gets caught;
But then if that sort of life is what you wish, you may grow up to be a fish.
And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo; every day you meet quite a few.
So you see it's all up to you --You can be better than you are, you..could..be..swing..n'..on..a..star,

SWING LOW, SWEET CHARIOT
Swing low, sweet chari-ot, comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chari-ot, comin' for to carry me home
I looked over Jordan, and what did I see, comin' for to carry me home?
A band of angels, comin' after me, comin' for to carry me home.
	CHORUS
If you get there be-fore I do, comin for to carry me home,
Tell all my friends I'm a'comin' too, comin' for to carry me home.
	CHORUS

SYLVIA'S MOTHER
Sylvia's mother says, "Sylvia's busy, too busy to come to the phone"
Sylvia's mother says, "Sylvia's trying, to start a new life of her own"
Sylvia's mother says, "Sylvia's happy so why don't you leave her alone?"
     And the operator says, "Forty cents more, for the next three minutes"
	Please Mrs. Avery, I've just got to talk to her, I'll only keep her a while
	Please Mrs. Avery, I just want to tell her goodbye

Sylvia's mother says, "Sylvia's marrying, a fellow down Galveston-Way"

     And the operator says, "Forty cents more, for the next three minutes"
	Please Mrs. Avery, I've just got to talk to her, I'll only keep her a while

Sylvia's mother says, "Sylvia's hurrying she's catching the nine o'clock train"
Sylvia's mother says, "Take your umbrella, 'cause Sylvia it's starting to rain"
And Sylvia's mother says, "Thank you for calling and sir won't you call back again"
     And the operator says, "Forty cents more, for the next three minutes"
	Please Mrs. Avery, I've just got to talk to her, I'll only keep her a while
	Please Mrs. Avery, I just want to tell her goodbye
	Tell her goodbye, please, tell her goodbye

TAKE A MESSAGE TO MARY
	These are the words of a frontier lad, who lost his love when he turned bad
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam
	You can tell her I had to see the world, tell her that my ship set sail
	You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail
	Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done
Please don't mention the stagecoach, and the shot from a careless gun
	You can tell her I had to change my plans, and cancel the wedding day
	But please don't mention my lonely cell, where I'm gonna pine away
	Until my dying day
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know
My heart's aching for Mary, Lord knows, I miss her so
	Just tell her I went to Timbuktu, tell her I'm searching for gold
	You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold
	Oh, Lord, this cell is cold. Mary, Mary, oh, Lord, this cell is cold.

TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY BABY
	My tears are fallin' 'cause you've taken her away
	And though it really hurts me so, there's something that I've gotta say
Take good care of my ba-by, please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her, make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do
Aww, take good care of my ba-by, now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her, paint a rainbow all around her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky
	Once upon a time that little girl was mine
	If I'd been true, I know she'd never be with you
So, take good care of my ba-by, be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover that you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
	Instrumental interlude
Well, take good care of my ba-by, be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover that you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

TAKE IT EASY
Well I'm a-runnin' down the road tryin' to loosen my load, I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me, one says she's a friend of mine
	Take it easy, take it easy, don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
	Lighten up while you still can, don't even try to understand
	Just find a place to make your stand, and take it easy
Well, I'm a-standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona, such a fine sight to see
It's a girl my lord in a flat-bed Ford, slowin' down to take a look at me
	Come on, baby, don't say maybe, I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
	We may lose and we may win, though we may never be here again
	So open up I'm climbin' in, so take it easy
Well, I'm a runnin' down the road tryin' to loosen my load, got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover, she's so hard to find
	Take it easy,  take it ea-sy, don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
	Come on ba-by, don't say may-be, I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me

TAKE IT TO THE LIMIT
All alone at the end of the evening, and the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have loved me, I never knew

You know, I've always been a dreamer, spent my life runnin' 'round
And it's so hard to change, can't seem to settle down
But the dreams I've seen lately keep turnin' out, and burnin' out, and turnin' out the same
     	So, put me on a highway, and show me a sign, and take it to the limit one more time
You can spend all your time makin' money, you can spend all your love makin' time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow,  would you still be mine?

And, when you're lookin' for your freedom, nobody seems to care
And you can't find the door, can't find it  anywhere
When there's nothin' to believe in, still you're comin' back,
You're runnin'  back, you're comin'  back for more
　　　　So, put me on a highway, and show me a sign, and take it to the limit one more time
     Take it to the limit, take it to the limit, take it to the limit one more time
     Take it to the limit, take it to the limit, take it to the limit one more time

TAKE ME HOME, COUNTRY ROADS
Almost   heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze
	Country roads, take me home to the place I belong:
	West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads
All my memories, gather 'round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
	Country roads, take me home to the place I belong:
	West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads
I hear her voice, in the mornin' hours she calls me, radio reminds me of my home far away
Drivin' down the road I get a feelin' that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong:
West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads... take me home, country roads

TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALLGAME
Katie Casey was baseball mad, had the fever and had it bad.
Just to root for the home town crew, every cent, Katie spent
On a Saturday her young beau called to see if she'd like to go
To see a show but Miss Kate said, "No, I'll tell you what you can do....."
	Take me out to the ballgame, take me out with the crowd.
	Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks, I don't care if I never get back, and it's
	Root, root, root for the home team, if they don't win it's a shame.
	For it's one, two, three strikes you're out at the old ball-game.
Katie Casey saw all the games, knew the players by their first names
Told the umpire he was wrong, all along, good and strong.
When the score was just two to two, Katie Casey knew what to do
Just to cheer up the boys she knew, she made the gang sing this song.....
	Take me out to the ballgame....................

TAKES TWO TO TANGO
　　　　Takes two to tango, two to tango, two to really get the feeling of romance
	Let's do the tango, do the tango, do the dance of love
You can sail on a ship by yourself, take a nap or nip by yourself
You can get into debt on your own, there are lots of things that you can do alone
	But, takes two to tango, two to tango, two to really get the feeling of romance
	Let's do the tango, do the tango, do the dance of love
You can croon to the moon by yourself, well you can laugh like a loon by yourself
Spend a lot go to pot on your own, there are a lot of things that you can do alone
	But, takes two to tango, two to tango, two to really get the feeling of romance
	Let's do the tango, do the tango, do the dance of love
　　　　You can haunt any house by yourself, be a man or a mouse by yourself
You can act like a king on a throne, there are lots of things that you can do alone
	But, takes two to tango, two to tango, two to really get the feeling of romance
	Let's do the tango, do the tango, do the dance of love

TAKE THE "A" TRAIN
You must take the "A" train, to go to Sugar Hill, way up in Harlem
If  you miss the "A" train, you'll find you missed the quickest way to Harlem
Hurry,  get on, now it's coming, listen to those rails a-thrumming
All a-board, get on the "A" train, soon you will be on Sugar Hill in Harlem
Soon you will be on Sugar Hill in Harlem

TAKE THESE CHAINS FROM MY HEART
Take these chains from my heart, and set me free.
You've grown cold, and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone, but the heartaches linger on
Take these chains from my heart, and set me free

Take these tears from my eyes, and let me see just a spark of the love that used to be
If you love somebody new, let me find a new love too
Take these chains from my heart, and set me free

Give my heart just a word of sympathy, be as fair to my heart as you can be
Then, if you no longer care for the love that's beating there
Take these chains from my heart, and set me free

Take these chains from my heart, and set me free.
You've grown cold, and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone, but the heartaches linger on
Take these chains from my heart, and set me free

TAKING A CHANCE ON LOVE
Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again
All aglow again, taking a chance on love
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again
I'm starry eyed again, taking a chance on love
	I thought the cards were a frame-up I would never try
	But now I'm taking the game up and the ace of hearts is high
All things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have a happy ending now, taking a chance on love.
Here I slip again, about to take that trip again
Got my grip again, taking a chance on love
Now I prove again, that I can make a move again
In the groove again, taking a chance on love
	I walk around with a horseshoe, in clover I lie
	And, brother rabbit, of course you better kiss your foot good-bye
On the ball again, I'm riding for a fall again
I'm gonna give my all again, taking a chance, taking a chance,
Taking.....a....chance...on...love.

TALK TO THE ANIMALS
If I could talk to the animals, just imagine it, chatting with a chimp in chimpanzee
Imagine talking to a tiger, chatting with a cheetah, what a neat achievement it would be

If we could talk to the animals, learn all their languages, maybe take an animal degree
I'd study elephant and eagle, buffalo and beagle, alligator, guinea pig, and flea
	I would converse in polar bear and python, and I would curse in fluent kangaroo
	If people asked me, "Can you speak rhinoceros?" I'd say, "Of courseros, can't you?"
If I conferred with our furry friends, man to animal, think of the amazing repartee
If I could walk with the animals, talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals, and they could talk to me

If I consulted with quadrupeds, think what fun we'd have asking over crocodiles for tea!
Or maybe lunch with two or three lions, walruses and sea lions
What a lovely place the world would be!

If I spoke slang to orangutans, the advantages, why any fool on earth could plainly see!
Discussing Eastern art and dramas, with intellectual llamas
That's a big step forward you'll agree!
	I'd learn to speak in antelope and turtle, and my Pekinese would be extremely good
	If I were asked to sing in hippopotamus, I'd say "whynotamus" and I would!
If I could parlay with pachyderms, it's a fairy tale worthy of Hans Anderson and Grimm
A man who walks with the animals, and talks with the animals
Grunts and squeaks and squawks with the animals and they could talk to him!
	I'd study every creature's language, so I could speak to all of them, on sight
	If friends said "can he talk in crab or maybe pelican"
	You'd say "Like hell, he can" and you'd be right!
And if you just stop and think of it, ain't no doubt of it, I'm gonna win a place in history
If I could walk with the animals, talk with the animals
Grunt, squeak, squawk with the animals
And they could squeak and squawk and speak and talk to me!

TANGERINE
Tangerine, she is all they claim, with her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame
Tangerine, when she dances by, senoritas stare and caballeros sigh
And I've seen toasts to Tangerine, raised in every bar across the Argentine
Yes, she has them all on the run, but her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine

TAPESTRY
My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view
A wondrous, woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold

Once amid the soft silver sadness in the sky
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide
And a coat of many colors, yellow-green on either side

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go
Once he reached for something golden hanging from a tree
And his hand came down empty

Soon within my tapestry along the rutted road
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure gray and ghostly beneath a flowing beard
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black
Now my tapestry's unraveling - he's come to take me back
He's come to take me back

TASTE OF HONEY
Winds may blow o'er the icy sea, I'll take with me the warmth of thee,
A taste of honey, a taste much sweeter than wine.
I will  return, I'll return, I'll come back for the honey and you
I'll leave behind my heart to wear and may it e'er remind you of
A taste of honey, a taste much sweeter than wine.
I will  return, I'll return, I'll come back for the honey and you
He ne'er came back to his love so fair, and so she died dreaming of his kiss
His kiss was honey, a taste more bitter than wine.
I will  return, I'll return, I'll come back for the honey and you

TEACH ME TONIGHT
Did you say, "I've got a lot to learn?" Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn, teach me tonight.
Starting with the "A, B, C" of it, right down to the "X, Y, Z" of it.
Help me solve this mystery of it, teach me tonight.
	The sky's a blackboard high above you, if a shooting star goes by
	I'll use that star to write I love you, a thousand times across the sky.
One thing isn't very clear, my love, should the teacher stand so near, my love,
Graduation's almost here, my love, teach me tonight.

TEACH YOUR CHILDREN WELL
You, who are on the road, must have a code that you can live by
And so, become yourself, because the past is just a goodbye
	Teach your children well, their father's hell did slowly go by
	And feed them on your dreams, the one they picks, the one you'll know by
	Don't you ever ask them why, if they told you, you would cry
	So just look at them and sigh, and know they love you
And you (Can you hear?) of tender years (And do you care?)
Can't know the fears (And can you see?) that your elders grew by (We must be free)
And so, please help (To teach your children) them with your youth (What you believe in)
They seek the truth (Make a world) before they can die (That we can live in)
	Teach your parents well, their children's hell will slowly go by
	And feed them on your dreams, the one they picks, the one you'll know by
	Don't you ever ask them why, if they told you, you will cry
	So just look at them and sigh, and know they love you

TEA FOR TWO
Picture you upon my knee just tea for two and two for tea
Just me for you and you for me a-lone
	Nobody near us to see us or hear us
	No friends or relations on week-end vacations
We won't have it known, dear, that we own a telephone, dear
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake a sugar cake
For me to take for all the boys to see.
	We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me.
	Oh can't you see how happy we will be.

TEARS OF A CLOWN
Now if there's a smile on my face, it's only there tryin' to fool the public
But when it comes down to fooling you, now, honey, that's quite a different subject

But don't let my glad expression give you the wrong impression
Really I'm sad, oh I'm sadder than sad, you're gone, and I'm hurtin' so bad
Like a clown I appear to be glad
	Now there're some sad things known to man, but ain't too much sadder than
	The tears of a clown when there's no one around, oh yeah, baby
Now if I appear to be carefree, it's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you that I've been happy since you
Decided to go, oh I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
But for others I put on a show
	Well, there're some sad things known to man, but ain't too much sadder than
	The tears of a clown when there's no one around,
Just like Pagliacci did, I try to keep my circus hid
Smiling in the public eye, but in my lonely room I cry
The tears of a clown, when there's no one around, oh yeah, baby
Now if there's a smile on my face, don't let my glad expression give you the wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear make you think that I don't care

TEARS ON MY PILLOW
You don't remember me, but I remember you. 'T was not so long ago, you broke my heart in two
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you, you
If we could start anew, I wouldn't hesitate. I'd gladly take you back, and tempt the hand of fate
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you,
	Love is not a gadget, love is not a toy
	When you find the one you love, she'll fill your heart with joy
If we could start anew, I wouldn't hesitate. I'd gladly take you back, and tempt the hands of fate
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you.

TEDDY BEARS' PICNIC
If you go out in the woods today, you're sure of a big surprise
If you go out in the woods today, you'd better go in disguise
	For every bear that ever there was will gather there for certain because
	Today's the day the teddy bears have their picnic.
Every teddy bear who's been good is sure of a treat today
There're lots of marvelous things to eat and wonderful games to play
	Beneath the trees, where nobody sees, they'll hide and seek as long as they please
	That's the way the teddy bears have their picnic
Picnic time for teddy bears, the little teddy bears are having a lovely time today
Watch them, catch them unawares, and see them picnic on their holiday
See them gaily dance about, they love to play and shout and never have any cares
At six o'clock their mommies and daddies will take them home to bed
Because they're tired little teddy bears.

If you go out in the woods today, you'd better not be alone
It's lovely out in the woods today, but safer to stay at home
	For every bear that ever there was will gather there for certain because
	Today's the day the teddy bears have their picnic.

A TEENAGER IN LOVE
Each time we have a quarrel, it almost breaks my heart
'Cause I am so afraid that we will have to part
Each night I ask the stars up above, why must I be a teenager in love?
One day I feel so happy, next day I feel so sad
I guess I'll learn to take the good with the bad
Each night I ask the stars up above, why must I be a teenager in love?
I cried a tear for nobody but you, I'll be a lonely one if you should say we're through
If you want to make me cry, that won't be so hard to do
And if you should say goodbye, I'll still go on loving you
Each night I ask the stars up above, why must I be a teenager in love?

TEEN ANGEL
That fateful night, the car was stalled, up-on the railroad track.
I pulled you out and we were safe, but you went running back.
	Teen angel, can you hear me? Teen angel, can you see me?
	Are you somewhere up above, and am I still your own true love?
What was it you were looking for, that took your life that night?
They said they found my high-school ring, clutched in your fingers, tight.  (chorus)
Just sweet sixteen, and now you're gone, they've taken you a-way.
I'll never kiss your lips again, they buried you today.  (chorus)
	Teen angel, teen angel, answer me, please.

TELL HER
I know something about love,  you've gotta want it bad
If that girl's got into your blood, go out and get her
If you want her to be, the very part of you
That makes you want to breathe, here's the thing to do
	Tell her that, you're never gonna leave her, tell her that, you're always gonna love her
	Tell her, tell her, tell her, tell her right now
I know something about love, you gotta show it, and
Make her see that moon up a-bove, reach out and get it
If you want her to be, always by your side, if you want her to, only think of you
	Tell her ........
      Ever since the world began, it's been that way for man, and women were cre-ated
      To make love their destiny, then why should true love be so compli-cated, oh yeah?
I know something about love, you gotta take her hand
Show her what the world is made of, one kiss will prove it
If you want her to be      always by your side,
Take her hand tonight,        swallow your foolish pride, and
	Tell her ........

TELL HER ABOUT IT
Listen boy, I don't  want  to  see you  let a good thing slip away
You know I don't like watching anybody make the same mistakes I made
She's a real nice girl and she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

Oh, listen boy, I'm sure that you think you got it all under control
You don't want somebody telling you the way to stay in someone's soul
You're a big boy now and you'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of  thing she ought to know
　　　　Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
	Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
　　　　Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
	Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means
Listen, boy, it's not automatically a certain guarantee
To insure yourself, you've got to provide communication constantly
When you love someone you're always insecure
And there's only one good way to reassure
	Tell her about it, let her know how much you care
	When she can't be with you, tell her you wish you were there
	 Tell her about it every day before you leave
	 Pay her some attention, give her something to believe
      'Cause now and then she gets to worrying, just because you haven't spoken for so long
       And though you may not have done anything, will that be a consolation when she's gone
Listen boy, it's good information from a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you could be the difference that it makes
She's a trusting soul, she put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you what you should do
　　　　Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
	Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
　　　　Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
	Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means

    	Tell her about it, tell her how you feel right now
    	Tell her about it, the girl don't want to wait too long
    	You got to tell her about it, tell her now and you won't go wrong
    	You got to tell her about it before it gets too late, you got to tell her about it

TELL IT LIKE IT IS
If you want something to play with, go and find yourself a toy
Baby, my time is too expensive, and I'm not your little boy
                                                     (and I don't want no little boy)
	If you are serious, don't play with my heart, it makes me furious
	But, if you want me to love you, then, baby, I will, girl/boy, you know I will
Tell it like it is, don't be ashamed, let your conscience be your guide
But I know, deep down inside of me, I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride
	Life is too short to have sorrow, you may be here today, and gone tomorrow
	You might as well get what you want, so, go on and live, girl, go on and live
Tell it like it is.....  (fade)

TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE
If you let me take your heart, I will prove to you
We will never be apart, if I'm a part of you
	Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
	It is no surprise now, what you see is me
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away
If you put your trust in me, I'll make bright your day
	Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see
	Don't you realize now, what you see is me.      Tell Me What You See
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through
Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you
	Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
	It is no surprise now, what you see is me.        Tell Me What You See
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through
Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you
	Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
	It is no surprise now, what you see is me.        Tell Me What You See

TELL ME WHY
	Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
	Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Well, I gave you everything I had, but you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad? All I do is hang my head and moan
	Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
	Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
If it's something that I've said or done, tell me what, and I'll apologize
If you don't I really can't go on, holding back these tears in my eyes
	Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
	Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Well, I beg you on my bended knees, if you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do, 'cause I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you
	Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
	Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

TELL OLD BILL
Tell old Bill, when he comes home this mornin'. Tell old Bill, when he comes home this evenin'
Tell old Bill, when he comes home To leave those downtown women alone
This mornin', this evenin', so soon
	Bill's woman was a bakin' bread this mornin'. Bill's woman was a bakin' bread this evenin'
	Bill's woman was a bakin' bread when they brought her the news that her Bill was dead
	This mornin', this evenin', so soon
Oh no, it can't be so, this mornin', this mornin'. Oh no, it can't be so, this evenin' so soon
Oh no, it can't be so, I saw my Bill about an hour ago
This mornin', this evenin', so soon
	They're bringin' Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this mornin'
	They're bringin' Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this evenin'
	They're bringin' Bill home in a hurry-up wagon. Can't you see how his shoes are draggin'
	This mornin', this evenin', so soon. This mornin' and this evenin', so soon

TEMPTATION
You came, I was alone, I should have known, you were temptation
You smiled, luring me on, my heart was gone, you were temptation
	It would be thrilling If you were willing
	If it can never be, pity me
For, you were born to be kissed, I can't resist
You are temptation and I am yours
Here is my heart, take it and say we'll never part
I'm just a slave, only a slave to you, temptation

For, you were born to be kissed, I can't resist
You are temptation and I am yours
Here is my heart, take it and say we'll never part
I'm just a slave, only a slave to you, temptation, I'm yours!

TENDERLY
The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly.
Then you and I came wandering by and lost in a sigh were we.
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly,
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly.
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside;
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly.

THE TENDER TRAP
You see a pair of laughing eyes, and suddenly you're sighing sighs
You're thinkin' nothing's wrong, you string along, boy, then snap!
Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap.
You're hand in hand beneath the trees, and soon there's music in the breeze
You're actin' kind of smart, until your heart just goes whap!
Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap.
	Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
	She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single
And all at once it seems so nice, the folks are throwin' shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map
You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
	Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
	She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single
And all at once it seems so nice, the folks are throwin' shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map
You wonder how it all came about, it's too late now, there's no getting out
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap!

TEN FEET OFF THE GROUND
	Who invented music? I'd like to shake his hand
	'Cause music casts a spell on me that I can't under-stand
	Must be some magician designed a magic plan
	He changed his wand (he changed his wand) to a baton,  (to a baton)
	And that's how it all be-gan,  that's how it all began
     When the rhythm pounds, and the harmony sounds, and the melody rolls around
      "Presto Change-o!" We're ten feet off the ground
     And when the rhythm pounds, and the harmony sounds, and the melody rolls a-round
     Right from the down beat, we can be found ten feet off the ground
When everybody puts his heart in it, everybody plays a part in it
That's how music magic is made
Everybody's toes get tapier, everybody's feeling happier
Lighter than air, out of his chair, ten feet off the ground

When everybody puts his heart in it, everybody plays a part in it
That's how music magic is made
Everybody's toe's get tapier, everybody's feeling happier
Lighter than air, out of his chair, floatin' along on the magical sound
Out of this world, and upward bound, ten...feet...off...the ground

TEN MINUTES AGO
Ten minutes ago I saw you
I looked up when you came through the door.
My head started reeling,
You gave me the feeling 
The room had no ceiling or floor.
Ten minutes ago I met you
And we murmured our how-do-you-do's.
I wanted to ring out the bells
And fling out my arms
And to sing out the news.

I have found her, she's an angel
With the dust of the stars in her eyes.
We are dancing, We are flying, 
And she's taking me back to the skies.
In the arms of my love Im flying
Over  mountain and meadow and g
And I like it so well
That for all I can tell
I may never come down again. 
I may never come down to earth again.

TENNESSEE WALTZ
I was dancin' with my darlin to the Tennessee Waltz when an old friend I happened to see.
I introduced him to my darlin' and while they were dancin' my friend stole my sweetheart from me.
	I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz 'cause I know just how much I have lost
	Yes I lost my little darlin' the night they were playin' that beautiful Tennessee Waltz
Now I wonder how a dance like the Tennessee Waltze could have broken my heart so complete
Well I couldn't blame my darlin', and who could help fallin' in love with my darlin' so sweet
	Well it must be the fault of the Tennessee Waltz wish I'd known just how much it would cost
	But I didn't see it commin', it's all over but the cryin' blame it all on the Tennessee Waltz

TEQUILA SUNRISE
It's another tequila sunrise, starin' slowly 'cross the sky, said goodbye
He was just a hired hand, workin' on the dreams he planned to try, the days go by
	Ev'ry night when the sun goes down, just another lonely boy in town
	And she's out runnin' 'round
She wasn't just another woman, and I couldn't keep from comin' on, it's been so long
Oh, and it's a hollow feelin',  when it comes down to dealin' friends, it never ends
      Take another shot of courage, wonder why the right words never come, you just get numb
It's another tequila sunrise, this old world still looks the same, another frame, mm...

TEXT ME MERRY CHRISTMAS
	This holiday, you'll be far away, and I'll be all alone
	So please remember, this December, to fully charge your phone, and
Text me Merry Christmas, let me know you care
Just a word or two of text from you will remind me you're still there
You don't have to add much to it, one smiley face will do :)

Baby, text me Merry Christmas, make my holiday complete
Though you're far from me, say you'll BRB, that's a text I'll never delete
Choose just the right emoji, one that makes me LOL
And if you text me something naughty, I promise I won't tell
	I don't care if you spell things right, I just want to hear from you tonight
	Stroke those keys with your delicate touch, and type those little words that mean so much
	A Facebook message isn't quite as sweet, I need more from @you than just a tweet
	A snap on Snapchat doesn't last, and voicemail, that's from Christmas past
Text me Merry Christmas, send a selfie too
If you do I'll go 'neath the mistle-toe and pretend my screen is you
	Show me that you love me, text XO to kiss and hug me
	I'll be right here waiting for my pants to start vibrating
Baby, text me Merry Christmas, and I will text you too.
This Christmas, it's the least that we can do.

THANK YOU FOR BEING A FRIEND
Thank you for bein' a friend, traveled down a road, and back again
Your heart is true, you're a pal and a confidant
I'm not ashamed to say, I hope it always will stay this way
My hat is off, won't you stand up, and take a bow
     And if you threw a party, invited everyone you knew
     Well, you would see the biggest gift would be from me, and the card attached would say
	Thank you for bein' a friend, thank you for bein' a friend
	Thank you for bein' a friend, thank you for bein' a friend
If it's a car you lack, I'd surely buy you a Cadillac
Whatever you need, any time of the day or night
I'm not ashamed to say, I hope it always will stay this way
My hat is off, won't you stand up, and take a bow
     And when we both get older, with walking canes and hair of gray
     Have no fear, even though it's hardly here, I will stand real close and say
	Thank you for bein' a friend, thank you for bein' a friend
	Thank you for bein' a friend, thank you for bein' a friend
 	Let me tell you 'bout a friend, thank you for bein' a friend
	Thank you for bein' a friend, thank you for bein' a friend
And when we die, and float away, into the night, the Milky Way
You'll hear me call, as we ascend, I'll say your name, then once again...Thank you for bein' a.....
	Thank you for bein' a friend, thank you for bein' a friend
	Thank you for bein' a friend, thank you for bein' a friend
 	Let me tell you 'bout a friend, thank you for bein' a friend
	Thank you for bein' a friend, thank you for bein' a friend

THAT FACE
That face, that face, that wonderful face! It shines, it glows all over the place
And how I love to watch it change expressions.
Each look becomes the prize of my possessions

I love that face, that face, it just isn't fair. You must forgive the way that I stare
But never will these eyes behold a sight that could replace
That face, that face, that face
	It's got my crazy heart in such a tangle
	It drives me simply wild from every angle
I love those eyes, those lips, that fabulous smile
She laughs and spring goes right out of style
Oh never will these eyes behold a sight that could replace
That face, that face, that face, such grace
Your place, my place, that face

THAT'LL BE THE DAY
Well, you give me all your lovin' and your turtle dovin',
All your hugs and kisses and your money too
Well, you know you love me, baby until you tell me, maybe
That some day, well, I'll be through!
	Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye, yes
	That'll be the day, when YOU MAKE ME CRY,
	You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie 'cause
	That'll be the day, when I die.
When Cupid shot his dart, he shot it at your heart, so if we ever part and I leave you
You say you told me an' you told me boldly, that some day, well, I'll be through. (chorus)

THAT LONESOME ROAD
Look down, look down that lonesome road, before you travel on
Look up, look up and seek your maker, before Gabriel blows his horn.
	I'm weary totin' such a load, trudgin' down that lonesome road
 	Look down, look down that lonesome road, before you travel on,
True love, true love, what have I done, that you should treat me so?
You caused me to walk and talk, like I never did before.

THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC
That old black magic has me in its spell. That old black magic that you weave so well
Those icy fingers up and down my spine, the same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine.
The same old tingle that I feel inside, and then that elevator starts its ride
Down and down I go, 'round and 'round I go, like a leaf that's caught in the tide.
	I should stay away but what can I do? I hear your name, and I'm aflame
	A flame with such a burning desire, that only your kiss, can put out the fire.
Fore you're the lover I have waited for, the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine, darling, down and down I go, 'round and 'round I go
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in, under that old black magic called love.

THAT OLE DEVIL CALLED LOVE
It's that ole devil called love again, gets behind me and keeps giving me that shove again
Putting rain in my eyes, tears in my dreams, and rocks in my heart
It's that sly old son of a gun again, he keeps telling me I'm the lucky one again
But I still have that rain, still have those tears, and those rocks on my heart
S'pose I didn't stay, run away, wouldn't play, the devil what a potion he would brew
He'd follow me round, build me up, tear me down
Till I'll be so bewildered I wouldn't know what to do
Might as well give up that fight again. I know darn well he'll convince me that he's right again
When he sings that sorry song I've just gotta tag along
With that ole devil called love, with that ole devil called love

THAT OLD FEELING
I saw you last night and got that old feeling. When you came in sight, I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by, I felt a thrill, and when you caught my eye, my heart stood still

Once again I seemed to get that old yearning, and I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start, 'cause that old feeling is still in my heart

THAT'S ALL
I can only give you love that lasts forever, and the promise to be near each time you call
And the only heart I own, for you and you alone, that's all, that's all
I can only give you country walks in springtime, and a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall
And a love whose burning light, will warm the winter night, that's all, that's  all
	There are those I am sure who have told you they would give you the world for a toy
	All I have are these arms to enfold you and a love time can never destroy
If you're wondering what I'm asking in return dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and evermore, that's all,
That's all, that's all, that's all.

THAT'S AMORE
When the moon hits your eye like a-big a-pizza pie, that's amore
When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine, that's amore
	Bells will ring, ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling, and you'll sing "veeta bella."
	Hearts will play, tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay like a gay tarantella.
When the stars make you drool just like pasta fazool, that's amore
When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet, you're in love
When you walk in a dream but you know you're not dreaming, signore,
Scuza me, but you see, back in old Napoli, that's amore

THAT'S AN IRISH LULLABY
Over in Killarney, many years a-go, me mother sang a song to me in tones so sweet and low
Just a simple little ditty in her good 'ould' Irish way
And I'd give the world if she could sing that song to me to-day.....
         Too-ra-loo-ra-loo--ral, Too-ra-loo-ra-li, Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, hush, now, don't you cry.
         Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, Too-ra-loo-ra-li, Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, that's an Irish lullaby.
Oft in dreams I wander to that cot again, I feel her arms a-huggin' me as when she held me then.
And I hear her voice a-hummin' to me as in days of yore,
When she used to rock me fast asleep outside the cabin door.
         Too-ra-loo-ra-loo--ral, Too-ra-loo-ra-li, Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, hush, now, don't you cry.
         Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, Too-ra-loo-ra-li, Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, that's an Irish lullaby.

THAT'S LIFE
That's life, that's what all the people say, you're ridin' high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune, when I'm back on top, back on top in June
  I said that's life, and as funny as it may seem, some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down, 'cause this fine old world, it keeps spinnin' around
	I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
	I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
	Each time I find myself flat on my face,  I pick myself up and get back in the race
That's life, I tell you I can't deny it, I thought of quitting, baby, but my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try, I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly
	I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
	I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
	Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face,  I pick myself up and get back in the race
That's life, that's life and I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cuttin' out but my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothin' shakin' come this here July
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball aand die..................my, my!

THAT'S MY DESIRE
To spend one night with you in our old rendezvous,
And reminisce with you, that's my desire

To meet where gypsies play, down in some dim café,
And dance till break of day, that's my desire
	We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine
	I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine
To hear you whisper low, just when it's time to go
Cherie, I love you so, you're my desire

To hear you whisper low, just when it's time to go
Cherie, I love you so, you're my desire

THAT'S MY HOME
When the sun sets  in the sky, and flowers never die, babe
Friends don't pass you by, 'cause that's my home
When the folks say how-de-do, like they mean it too,
Where mama's love is true, 'cause that's my home
I'm always welcomed back, no matter where I roam.
Just a little shack to me is home sweet home.
Where the Swanee river flows, the shady pine tree grows.
I needn't say no more, 'cause that's my home


THAT SUNDAY (THAT SUMMER)
	If I had to choose just one day
If I had to choose just one day to last my whole life through
It would surely be that Sunday, the day that I met you
	Newborn whippoorwills were calling from the hills
	Summer was a-coming in, but fast
	Lots of daffodils were showing off their skills
	Nodding all together, I could almost hear them whisper
	"Go on, kiss her, go on and kiss her"
But, if I had to choose one moment to live within my heart
It would be that tender moment, recalling how we started
Darling, it would be when you smiled at me that way, that Sunday, that summer
	Newborn whippoorwills were calling from the hills
	Summer was a-coming in, but fast
	Lots of daffodils were showing off their skills
	Nodding all together, I could almost hear them whisper
	"Go on, kiss her, go on and kiss her now"
If I had to choose one moment to live within my heart
It would be that tender moment, recalling how we started
Darling, it would be when you smiled at me that way, that Sunday, that summer
	If I had to choose just one day

THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR
And I never thought I'd feel this way, and as far as I'm con-cerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say that I do believe I love you
And if I should ever   go a-way, well then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do to-day, and then if you can re-member
	      Keep smiling, keep shining, knowing you can always count on me, for sure,
	     That's what friends are for
	      For good times and bad times, I'll be on your side forevermore
	     That's what friends are for
Well you came and opened me, and now there's so much more I see,  and so, by the way, I thank you
Oh, and then for the times when we're apart, well then close your eyes and know
The words are coming from my heart, and then if you can re-member
	      Keep smiling, keep shining, knowing you can always count on me, for sure,
	     That's what friends are for
	      In good times, in bad times, I'll be on your side forevermore
	      Oh, that's what friends are for

THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR LOVING ME
	That's what you get for loving me. That's what you get for loving me
	Everything you had is gone, as you can see, that's what you get for loving me
I ain't the kind to hang around with any new love that I've found
Movin' is my stock and trade, I'm movin' on, I won't think of you when I'm gone

So don't you shed a tear for me. I ain't the love you thought I'd be
I've got a hundred more like you, so don't be blue.  I'll have a thousand 'fore I'm through

Now there you go, you're cryin' again. Now there you go, you're cryin' again
But then some day when your poor heart is on the mend, I just might pass this way again
	That's what you get.....

THEM THERE EYES
I fell in love with you first time I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin' with them there eyes
	They make me feel happy, they make me blue
	No stallin', I'm fallin', goin' in a big way for sweet little you
My heart is jumpin', you sure started somethin' with them there eyes
You'd better watch them, if you're wise
	They sparkle, they bubble, they're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
	You're overworkin' 'em, there's danger lurkin' in them there eyes

THEN I'D BE SATISFIED WITH LIFE
All I want is 50 million dollars, and seal skins to protect me from the cold
If I only knew how stocks would do on Wall Street, and were living in a mansion built of gold
If I only owned the Pennsylvania Railroad, and if Taylor Swift would only be my wife
	If I could only stay sixteen for-ever, then I know that I'd be satisfied with life
All I want are Crepe Suzettes for breakfast, and a champagne fountain sizzlin' at my feet
While Donald Trump was waiting on my table, and The Rolling Stones were playing while I eat
If I only owned the Western Union Railroad, and if Taylor Swift would only be my wife
	If I could only stay sixteen for-ever, then I know that I'd be satisfied with life
	If I could only stay sixteen for-ever, then I know that I'd be satisfied,
	I know that I'd be satisfied, yes, I know that I'd be satisfied with life!

THEN I KISSED HER
Well, I walked up to her, and I asked her if she wanted to dance
She looked awful nice, and so I hoped she might take a chance
     When we danced I held her tight, then I walked her home that night
     And all the stars were shining bright, and then I kissed her
Each time I saw her I couldn't wait to see her again
I wanted to let her know that I was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do, and so I whispered I love you
And she said that she loved me too, and then I kissed her
	I kissed her in a way that I'd never kissed a girl before
	I kissed her in a way that I hope she liked for evermore
I knew that she was mine, so I gave her all the love that I had
Then one day she'll take me home to meet her mom and her dad
     Then I asked her to be my bride, and always be right by my side
     I felt so happy that I almost cried, and then I kissed her
     And then I kissed her, and then I kissed her

THEN I'LL BE HAPPY
	First you bring me joy, then bring me sorrow
	Why, you're just here today, then gone tomorrow
	Why can't I have you for my own? Tell me why must I stay here all alone?
I wanna go where you go, do what you do, love when you love, then I'll be happy
I wanna sigh when you sigh, cry when you cry, smile when you smile, then I'll be happy
            If you go north or south, if you go east or west,
	I'll follow you, sweetheart, and share your little love nest
I wanna go where you go, do what you do, love when you love, then I'll be happy

THEN I'LL BE TIRED OF YOU
You look at me and wonder, you look at me and doubt
Darling, your eyes still ask me will the flame burn out?
No one is sure of sunshine, no one is sure of dawn
But I am sure our love will live on and on

I'll be tired of you when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of you
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired of you
	Beyond the years, till day is night, till wrong is right, till birds refuse to sing
	Beyond the years, the echo of my only love will still be whispering, whispering
If my throbbing heart should ever start repeating
That it is tired of beating, then I'll be tired of you!

THEN YOU CAN TELL ME GOOD-BYE
Kiss me each morning for a million years, hold me each evening at your side
Tell me you love me for a million years
	Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out, then you can tell me good-bye
Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss, soften my dreams with your sighs
Tell me you love me for a million years
     Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out, then you can tell me good-bye
     Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out, then you can tell me good-bye
                 If you must go, oh no, I won't grieve, if you wait a lifetime be-fore you leave
But if you must go mmm, I won't tell you no, just so that we can say we tried
            Tell me you love me for a million years
     Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out, then you can tell me good-bye
     Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out, then you can tell me good-bye

THERE GOES MY BABY
There goes my baby, movin' on down the line.
Wonder where, wonder where, wonder where she is bound
I broke her heart, and made her cry.
Now I'm alone, so all alone, what can I do, what can I do?
	(There goes my baby), whoa, oh, (there goes my baby) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
	(There goes my baby), whoa, oh, (there she goes) yeah, I wanna know if she loves me
Did she really love me? Was she just playing me for a fool?
I wonder why she left me, why did she leave me, so all alone, so all alone?
I just wanna tell her that I love her, and that I need her beside my side, to be my guide
I wanna know, where is my......where is my baby, I want my baby, I need my baby.
Yeah, whoa, oh (there goes my baby)

THERE IS A TAVERN IN THE TOWN
There is a tavern in the town, in the town
And there my true love sits him down, sits him down
And drinks his wine as merry as can be
And never, never thinks of me.
     CHORUS:
Fare thee well, for I must leave thee, do not let this parting grieve thee
And remember that the best of friends must part, must part.
Adieu, adieu kind friends, adieu (yes adieu)
I can no longer stay with you, stay with you
I'll hang my harp on the weeping willow tree, and may the world go well with thee.
He left me for a damsel dark, damsel dark
Each Friday night they used to spark, used to spark,
And now my love once true to me, takes that dark damsel on his knee.
  CHORUS
Oh, dig my grave both wide and deep, wide and deep.
Put tombstones at my head and feet, head and feet.
And on my breast carve a turtle dove, to signify I died of love
  CHORUS

THERE'LL BE SOME CHANGES MADE
There'll be a change in the weather and a change in the sea
From now on there'll be a change in me;
My walk will be different, my talk and my name.  Nothin' about me's gonna be the same
I'm gonna change my way of livin' and if that ain't enough
I'm gonna change the way I strut my stuff.
Nobody wants you when you're old and gray
There'll be some changes made today, there'll be some changes made.

THERE'S A KIND OF HUSH
There's a kind of hush all over the world tonight.
All over the world you can hear the sounds of lovers in love, you know what I mean.
Just the two of us and nobody else in sight.
There's nobody else and I'm feeling good just holding you tight.
	So listen very carefully, closer now and you will see what I mean. It isn't a dream.
	The only sound that you will hear is when I whisper in your ear, I love you, forever and ever.
There's a kind of hush all over the world tonight.
All over the world you can hear the sounds of lovers in love.      La-la-la-la-la-la-la.........
	So listen very carefully, closer now and you will see what I mean. It isn't a dream.
	The only sound that you will hear is when I whisper in your ear, I love you, forever and ever.
There's a kind of hush all over the world tonight.
All over the world people just like us are fallin' in love.
Yeah, they're fallin' in love.  Hush, they're fallin' in love. Hush.

THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING THERE TO REMIND ME
I walk along the city streets you used to walk along with me
And every step I take recalls how much in love we used to be
Oh, how can I forget you, when there is
Always something there to remind me, always something there to remind me
	I was born to love you, and I will never be free
	You'll always be a part of me.  Wo, wo, wo,
When shadows fall, I pass a small cafe where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight
Oh, how can I for-et you, when there is
Always something there to remind me, always something there to remind me
	I was born to love you, and I will never be free
	You'll always be a part of me.  Wo, wo, wo,
     If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share
    Just come back to the places where we used to go, and I'll be there
Oh, how can I for-get you, when there is
Always something there to remind me, always something there to remind me
	I was born to love you, and I will never be free, when there is, when there is
	When... there... is...always something there to remind me

THERE'S A MEETIN' HERE TONIGHT
There is a meetin', mm mm, there is a meetin', mm mm, there is a meetin', mm mm, there is a meetin',
Mm mm, there is a meetin' here tonight, there is a meetin' here tonight,
There is a meetin' here tonight, there is a meetin' here tonight,
	Well, there's a meetin' here tonight, there's a meetin' here tonight,
	I can tell  by your friendly face, there's a meetin' here tonight.
	There's a meetin' here tonight, there's a meetin' here tonight,
	I can tell  by your friendly face, there's a meetin' here tonight.
Well, I went down to the valley one day (I went down to the valley one day)
Met old Satan on my way (met old Satan on my way)
What do you reckon old Satan did say (what do you reckon old Satan did say)
He said, "Turn back, young man, you're too young to pray, too young to pray, to young to pray
	Well, there's a meetin' here tonight, there's a meetin' here tonight,
	I can tell  by your friendly face, there's a meetin' here tonight.
Well, Satan is mad, and I am glad (Satan is mad, and I am glad)
Lost the soul he thought he had (lost the soul he thought he had)
Satan is a liar, and I conjure too (Satan is a liar, and I conjure too)
You better watch out, brother, he'll conjure you, conjure you, conjure you
	Well, there's a meetin' here tonight, there's a meetin' here tonight,
	I can tell  by your friendly face, there's a meetin' here tonight.

THERE'S A RAINBOW 'ROUND MY SHOULDER
      I'm happy, so happy, walkin' on air. The why and the wherefore is someone I care for
      I'm yellin', and tellin' folks everywhere. I know that she loves me, so, what do I care?
There's a rainbow 'round my shoulder, and a sky of blue above
Oh, the sun shines bright, the world's alright, 'cause I'm in love

There's a rainbow 'round my shoulder, and it fits me like a glove
Let it blow, let it storm, I'll be warm, 'cause I'm in love
	Hallelujah, how the folks will stare, when they see the solitaire
	That my little sugar baby's gonna wear
There's a rainbow 'round my shoulder, and a sky of blue above
And I'm shoutin' so the world will know that I'm in love
	Hallelujah, how the folks will stare, when they see the solitaire
	That my little sugar baby's gonna wear
There's a rainbow 'round my shoulder, and a sky of blue above
And I'm shoutin' so the world will know that I'm in love
That I'm in love, that I'm in love

THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS
	The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
	Are secretly unhappy men because
	The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
	Get paid for what they do but no applause.
	They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?
There's no business like show business like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow
There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show
	The costumes, the scenery, the makeup, the props,
	The audience that lifts you when you're down
	The headaches, the heartaches, the backaches, the flops
	The sheriff who escorts you out of town
	The opening when your heart beats like a drum, the closing when the customers won't come
There's no business like show business like no business I know
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on
There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Yesterday they told you you would not go far, that night you open and there you are
Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the show!

THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER YOU
There will be many other nights like this,
And I'll be standing here with someone new.
There will be other songs to sing, another fall...another spring...
But there will never be another you.
There will be other lips that I may kiss,
But they won't thrill me like yours used to do.
Yes, I may dream a million dreams, but how can they come true,
If there will never, ever be another you?

THESE EYES
These eyes cry every night for you. These arms long to hold you again
The hurtin's on me, yeah, but I will never be free, no, my baby, no, no
You gave a promise to me, yeah, and you broke it, you broke it, oh, no

These eyes watched you bring my world to an end. This heart could not accept and pretend
The hurtin's on me, yeah, but I will never be free, no, no, no
You took the vow with me, yeah, and you spoke it, you spoke it, babe
	These eyes are cryin', these eyes have seen a lot of loves
	But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you

THESE FOOLISH THINGS
A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces, an airline ticket to romantic places,
And still my heart has wings. These foolish things remind me of you.

A tinkling piano in the next apartment, those stumblin' words that told you what my heart meant
A fairground's painted swings. These foolish things remind me of you.
	You came, you saw, you conquered me. When you did that to me,
	I knew somehow this had to be.
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer, a telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings. These foolish things remind me of you.

THEY ALL LAUGHED
The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from Missouri never incensed me, oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from history I had learned how many, many times the worm had turned

They all laughed at Christopher Columbus when he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother when they said that man could fly
They told Marconi wireless was a phony, it's the same old cry
	They laughed at me wanting you, said I was reaching for the moon
	But oh, you came through, now they'll have to change their tune
	They all said we never could be happy, they laughed at us and how!
	But ho, ho, ho! Who's got the last laugh now?
They all laughed at Rockefeller Center, now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed Fulton and his steamboat, Hershey and his chocolate bar
Ford and his Lizzie, kept the laughers busy, that's how people are
	They laughed at me wanting you, said it would be, "Hello, Goodbye."
	But oh, you came through, now they're eating humble pie
	They all said we'd never get together, darling, let's take a bow
	For ho, ho, ho! Who's got the last laugh? Hee, hee, hee! Let's at the past laugh,
	Ha, ha, ha! Who's got the last laugh now?

THEY CALL THE WIND MARIAH
Away out here they've got a name for rain and wind and fire.
The rain is Tess, the fire's Joe, and they call the wind Mariah.
Mariah blows the stars around and sends the clouds a-flyin'.
Mariah makes the mountains sound like folks were up there dyin'.
Mariah, Mariah, they call the wind Mariah.
	Before I knew Maria's name and heard her wail and whinin',
	I had a girl and she had me and the sun was always shinin'.
	But then one day I left my girl. I left her far behind me
	And now I'm lost, so gol' durn lost, not even God can find me.
	Mariah, Mariah, they call the wind Mariah.
Out here they got a name for rain, for wind and fire only.
But when you're lost and all alone, there ain't no word but lonely.
And I'm a lost and lonely man without a star to guide me.
Maria blow my love to me. I need my girl beside me.
Mariah, Mariah, they call the wind Mariah. Mariah, Mariah, they call the wind Mariah.

THEY CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME
The way you wear your hat, the way you sip your tea
The memory of all that, no, no they can't take that away from me
The way your smile just beams, the way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams, no, no they can't take that away from me.
	We may never, never meet again on the bumpy road to love
	But I'll always, always keep the memory of...
The way you hold your knife, they way we danced till three
The way you changed my life, no, no they can't take that away from me.

THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ME
And when I told them how beautiful you are, they didn't believe me, they didn't believe me
Your lips, your eyes, your cheeks, your hair are in a class beyond compare
You're the loveliest girl that one could see!

And when I tell them, and I certainly am going to tell them
That I'm the man whose wife one day you'll be
They'll never believe me, they'll never believe me
That from this great big world you've chosen me (x2)

THEY SAY IT'S WONDERFUL
Rumors fly and you can't tell where they start, 'specially when it concerns a person's heart.
I've heard tales that could set my heart aglow, wish I knew if the things I hear are so

They say that falling in love is wonderful, it's wonderful, so they say
And with a moon up above, it's wonderful, it's wonderful, so they tell me
I can't recall who said it, I know I never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance is wonderful, wonderful in every way, so they say.

Rumors fly and you can't tell where they start, but you've come to the right place to find out
Everything that you've heard is really so, I've been there once or twice, and I should know

You'll find that falling in love is wonderful, it's wonderful, so they say
And with a moon up above, it's wonderful, it's wonderful, so they tell me
To leave your house some morning, and without any warning,
You're stopping people, shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a girl in your arms is wonderful, wonderful in every way, so they say.

THEY WERE YOU
When the moon was young, when the month was May, when the stage was hung for my holiday
I saw shining lights, but I never knew they were you, they were you, they were you.

When the dance was done, when I went my way, when I tried to find rainbows far away
All the lovely lights seemed to fade from view, they were you, they were you, they were you
	Without you near me, I can't see. 	When you're near me, wonderful things come to be
Every secret prayer, every fancy free, everything I dared for both you and me
All my wildest dreams, multiplied by two, they were you, they were you, they were you
They were you, they were you, they were you

THINGS
Every night I sit here by my window, staring at the lonely avenue
Watching lovers holding hands and laughing, and thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
   (Thinkin' of things), like a walk in the park, (things), like a kiss in the dark
   (Things) like a sailboat ride (yeah, yeah) what about the night we cried
   Things, like a lover's vow, things that we don't do now, thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
Memories are all I have to cling to, and heartaches are the friends  I'm talking to
When I'm not thinkin' of just how much I love you, I'm thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
   (Thinkin' of things), like a walk in the park, (things), like a kiss in the dark
   (Things) like a sailboat ride (yeah, yeah) what about the night we cried
   Things, like a lover's vow, things that we don't do now, thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
I still can hear the jukebox softly playing, and the face I see each day belongs to you
Though there's not a single sound and there's nobody else around,
Well, there's just me thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
   (Thinkin' of things), like a walk in the park, (things), like a kiss in the dark
   (Things) like a sailboat ride (yeah, yeah) what about the night we cried
   Things, like a lover's vow, things that we don't do now, thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
And the heartaches are the friends I'm talkin' to
You got me thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
Starin' at the lonely avenue

THE THINGS WE DID LAST SUMMER
The boat rides we would take, the moonlight on the lake
The way we danced and hummed our favorite song
The things we did last summer, I'll remember all winter long

The midway and the fun, the kewpie dolls we won
The bell I/you rang to prove that I was/you were strong
The things we did last summer, I'll remember all winter long
     The early morning hike, the rented tandem bike, the lunches that we used to pack
     We never could explain that sudden summer rain, the looks we got when we got back
The leaves began to fade like promises we made,
How could a love that seemed so right go wrong?
The things we did last summer, I'll remember all winter long

I've tried so to forget, at times I do, and yet, the memory of you lingers like our song
The things we did last summer, I'll remember all winter long

THINGS WE SAID TODAY
You say you will love me if I have to go,
You'll be thinking of me, somehow I will know,
Someday when I'm lonely, wishing you weren't so far away,
Then I will remember things we said today.
You say you will be mine, girl, till the end of time,
These days such a kind girl seems so hard to find,
Someday when we're dreaming, deep in love, not a lot to say,
Then I will remember things we said today.
	Me I'm just a lucky kind, love to hear you say that love is love,
	And though we may be blind, love is hear to stay.
And that's enough to make you mine girl, me the only one,
Love me all the time girl, we'll go on and on,
Someday when we're dreaming, deep in love, not a lot to say,
Then I will remember things we said today.

THIS BOY
That boy took my love away, though he'll regret it someday, but this boy wants you back again

That boy isn't good for you, though he may want you too, this boy wants you back again.
	Oh, and this boy would be happy just to love you, but, oh my
	That boy won't be happy till he's seen you cry
This boy wouldn't mind the pain, would always feel the same, if this boy gets you back again
This boy, this boy, this boy

THIS CAN'T BE LOVE
This can't be love because I feel so well, no sobs, no sorrows, no sighs
This can't be love I get no dizzy spells, my head is not in the sky
	My heart does not stand still just hear it beat, this is too sweet to be love
This can't be love because I feel so well, but still I love to look in your eyes

THIS COULD BE THE START OF SOMETHING BIG
You're walkin' along the street, or you're at a party,
Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig,
You're looking' in someone's eyes, you suddenly realize
That this could be the start of something big.

You're lunching at Twenty-One and watchin' your diet,
Declining a charlotte russe, accepting a fig,
When out of a clear blue sky, it's suddenly gal and guy,
And this could be the start of something big.
	There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend,
	Who knows what's written in the magic book.
	But when a lover you discover at the gate my friend,
	Invite her in without a second look.
You're up in an aeroplane or dining at Sardi's,
Or lying at Malibu alone on the sand,
You suddenly hear a bell, and right away you can tell
	That this could be the start of something grand.
	This could be the start of something very big,
	Why don't you play your part? Please give your heart to me....and see.
	This could be the start of something wonderful,
	Why don't you take a chance? Just try romance with me....and see.
Your watchin' the sun come up and countin' your money,
Or else in a dim cafe you're ordering wine,
Then suddenly there he is, and you wanna be where he is,
And this must be the start of something...
This could be the heart of something...
This could be the start of something big.

THIS DIAMOND RING
Who wants to buy this diamond ring?
She took it off her finger now, it doesn't mean a thing
	This diamond ring doesn't shine for me anymore
	And this diamond ring doesn't mean what it did before
	So if you've got someone whose love is true
	     Let it shine for you
This stone is genuine, like love should be
And if your baby's truer than my baby was to me
	This diamond ring can be something beautiful
	And this diamond ring can be dreams that are coming true
	And then your heart won't have to break like mine did
	     If there's love behind it

THIS GUY'S IN LOVE WITH YOU
You see this guy, this guy's in love with you
Yes, I'm in love. Who looks at you the way I do?
	When you smile, I can tell we know each other very well
	How can I show you I'm glad I got to know you, 'cause
I've heard some talk, they say you think I'm fine
Yes, I'm in love, and what I'd do to make you mine
	Tell me now, is it so? Don't let me be the last to know
	My hands are shaking, don't let my heart keep breakin' 'cause
     I need your love, I want your love.
     Say you're in love, in love with this guy. If not I'll just die
	Tell me now, is it so? Don't let me be the last to know
	My hands are shaking, don't let my heart keep breakin' 'cause
     I need your love, I want your love.
     Say you're in love, in love with this guy. If not, I'll just die

THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND
This land is your land, this land is my land, from California to the New York island,
From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream wa-ters, this land was made for you and me.
	As I was walking that ribbon of highway, I saw above me that endless skyway
	I saw below me that golden val-ley, this land was made for you and me.
I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps, to the sparkling sand of her diamond deserts
And all around me a voice was sounding, this land was made for you and me.
	This land is your land.......

THIS LITTLE BIRD
There's a little bird that somebody sends down to the earth to live on the wind
Born on the wind, and he sleeps on the wind, this little bird that somebody sends

He's light and fragile, and feathered sky blue, so thin and graceful, the sun shines through
This little bird that lives on the wind, this little bird that somebody sends
	He flies so high up in the sky, out of reach of human eye
	And the only time that he touches the ground, is when that little bird,
	Is when that little bird, is when that little bird dies

THIS LITTLE LIGHT OF MINE
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine (X3), let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
Everywhere I go, I'm gonna let it shine (X3), let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
All around the town, I'm gonna let it shine (X3), let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine (X3), let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

THIS MAGIC MOMENT
This magic moment so different and so new, was like any other until I kissed you
And then it happened it took me by surprise. I knew that you felt it too by the look in your eyes
    Sweeter than wine (sweeter than wine) Softer than a summer night  (softer than a sumer night)
    Everything I want I have whenever I hold you tight
This magic moment while your lips are close to mine
Will last forever,  forever till the end of time
Whoa  oh  oh  oh  oh  Whoa  oh  oh  oh  oh    Whoa  oh  oh   oh

THIS MASQUERADE
Are we really happy in this lonely game we play? Looking for words to say.
Searching but not finding understanding anyway, we're lost in this masquerade
	Both afraid to say we're just too far away from being close together from the start
	We tried to talk it over, but the words got in the way. We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of leaving disappear every time I see your eyes,  no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason that we carry on this way. We're lost in this masquerade.

THIS NEARLY WAS MINE
One dream in my heart, one love to be living for. One love to be living for, this nearly was mine
One girl for my dream, one partner in paradise. This promise of paradise, this nearly was mine.
	Close to my heart she came, only to fly away. Only to fly, as day flies from moonlight
Now, now I'm alone, still dreaming of paradise, still saying that paradise once nearly was mine

THIS NIGHT WON'T LAST FOREVER
Everybody likes a celebration, happy music and conversation
I'd be lying, if I said I didn't have the blues
In the corner there's a couple dancin', from the kitchen I can hear them laughin'
Oh, I wish I was celebrating too
	I know this night won't last forever, I know the sun is gonna shine sometime
	I need some hope for a bright tomorrow, and I know this heart is gonna mend just fine
So, pardon me for my disposition, I wish I didn't have to sit and listen
They're playing the same old songs on the stereo
She's been lyin' since the day I met her, I'd be better off to just forget her
Oh, I would rather be lonesome, or go
	I know this night won't last forever, I know the sun's got to shine sometime
	I need some hope for a bright tomorrow, and I know this heart is gonna mend just fine
     Such a ridiculous situation, pretendin' that nothin's wrong
     She's comin' on with the invitation, I wonder who is takin' her home
	I know this night won't last forever, I know the sun's got to shine sometime
	I need some hope for a bright tomorrow, and I know this heart is gonna mend just fine

THIS OLD GUITAR
This old guitar taught me to sing a love song, it showed me how to laugh and how to cry.
It introduced me to some friends of mine, and brightened up some days
And helped me make it through some lonely nights, oh,
What a friend to have on a cold and lonely night

This old guitar gave me my lovely lady, it opened up her eyes and ears to me
It brought us close together, and I guess it broke her heart
But it opened up a space for us to be,
What a lovely place and a lovely space to be

This old guitar gave me my life, my living, all the things you know I love to do
To serenade the stars that shine from a sunny mountain side,
But most of all, to sing my songs to you, I love to sing my songs to you,
Yes I do, I love to sing my songs to you.

THIS OLE HOUSE
This ole house once knew my children, this ole house once knew my life.
This ole house was home and comfort as we lived through storm and strife.
This ole house once rang with laughter, this ole house heard many shouts.
Now she trembles in the darkness when the lightning walks about.

Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer, ain't a-gonna need this house no more.
Ain't got time to fix the shingles, ain't got time to fix the floor.
Ain't got time to oil the hinges, nor to mend the window panes.
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer, I'm a-gettin' ready to meet the saints.

This ole house is gettin' shaky, this ole house is gettin' old.
This ole house lets in the rain, this ole house lets in the cold.
On my knees I'm gettin' shaky, but I feel no fear or pain,
'Cause I see an angel peekin' through a broken window pane.

This ole house is afraid of thunder, this ole house is afraid of storms.
This ole house just groans and trembles when the night wind flings its arms.
This ole house is gettin' feeble, this old house is needin' paint.
Just like me it's tuckered out, but I'm a-gettin' ready to meet the saints.

THIS TRAIN
This train don't carry no gamblers, this train.
This train don't carry no gamblers, this train.
This train don't carry no gamblers,
no crap shooters, no midnight ramblers,
This train don't carry no gamblers, this train.

This train, don't carry no jokers, well, this train.
This train, don't carry no jokers, well, this train.
This train, don't carry no jokers,
no high-tone women, no cigar smokers, well
This train, don't carry no jokers, well, this train.

This train, done carried my mother, well, this train.
This train, done carried my mother, well, this train.
This train, done carried my mother,
my mother, my father, my sister and my brother,
This train, done carried my mother, well this train.

This train, she's bound for glory, well, this train
This train, she's bound for glory, well, this train
This train, she's bound for glory, well, this train
This train, she's bound for glory,
If you want to get to heaven then you've got to be holy, well,
This train, she's bound for glory, well, this train

THIS WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH
This will make you laugh. I staked my dreams on you.
This will make you laugh. They never did come true.
	I took a chance on the one romance, I vowed it couldn't miss.
	But I should have known to never judge a heart by a kiss.
This will make you laugh. I once believed in you.
And for all my love, you didn't see it through.
	Of all the fools, I break the rules. I love you still you see
	This will make you laugh, but it's not funny to me.

THOSE LAZY-HAZY-CRAZY DAYS OF SUMMER
   Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer, those days of soda and pretzels and beer
   Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer, dust off the sun and moon and sing a song of cheer
Just fill your basket full of sandwiches and weenies then lock the house up now you're set
And on the beach you'll see the girls in their bikinis, as cute as ever but they never get them wet
   Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer, those days of soda and pretzels and beer
   Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer, you'll wish that summer could always be here
Don't have to tell a girl and feller 'bout a drive in or some romantic movie scene
Why from the moment that those lovers start arrivin'
You'll see more kissing in the cars than on the screen
   Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer, those days of soda and pretzels and beer
   Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer, you'll wish that summer could always be here
And there's the good old fashioned picnic, and they still go, always will go any time
And there will always be a moment that can thrill so, as when the old quartet sings out "Sweet Adeline"
   Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer, those days of soda and pretzels and beer
   Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer, you'll wish that summer could always be here
   You'll wish that summer could always be here, you'll wish that summer could always be here

THOSE LITTLE WHITE LIES
The moon was all aglow and heaven was in your eyes,
The night that you told me those little white lies
The stars all seemed to know that you didn't mean all those sighs
The night that you told me, those little white lies
	I try, but there's no forgetting when evening appears
	I sigh, but there's no regretting in spite of my tears
The devil was in your heart but heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me those little white lies

THOSE WERE THE DAYS
Once upon a time there was a tavern where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours and dreamed of all the great things we would do
	Those were the days my friend, we thought they'd never end
	We'd sing and dance forever and a day
	We'd live the life we'd choose, we'd fight and never lose,
	For we were young and sure to have our way.
	Lai lai lai lai lai lai lai, lai lai lai lai lai lai, lai lai lai lai lai lai lai lai lai lai
	Lai lai lai lai lai lai, lai lai lai lai lai lai lai, lai lai lai lai lai lai lai lai lai lai
Then the busy years went rushing by us, we lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern, we'd smile at one another and we'd say
	Refrain
Through the door there came familiar laughter, I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh, my friends, we're older but no wiser, for in our hearts the dreams are still the same
	Refrain

THOSE WERE THE DAYS (ARCHIE BUNKER)
Boy, the way Glenn Miller played, songs that made the hit parade
Guys like us, we had it made, those were the days

Didn't need no welfare states, everybody pulled his weight
Gee, our old LaSalle ran great, those were the days
	And you knew who you were then, girls were girls, and men were men
	Mister, we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again
People seemed to be content, fifty dollars payed the rent
Freaks were in a circus tent, those were the days
	Take a little Sunday spin, tonight I'll watch the Dodgers win
	Have yourself a dandy day that cost you under a fin
Hair was short, and skirts were long, Kate Smith really sung the song
I don't know just what went wrong, THOSE WERE THE DAYS!

THOU SWELL
Thou swell, thou witty, thou sweet, thou grand
Wouldst kiss me pretty? Wouldst hold my hand?
Both thine eyes are cute too, what they do to me
Hear me holler, I choose a sweet lollapaloosa in thee

I'd feel so rich in a hut for two
Two rooms and kitchen I'm sure would do
Give me just a plot of, not a lot of land
And thou swell, thou witty, thou grand

THREE COINS IN THE FOUNTAIN
Three coins in the fountain, each one seeking happiness
Thrown by three hopeful lovers, which one will the fountain bless?
Three hearts in the fountain, each heart longing for its home
There they lie in the fountain, somewhere in the heart of Rome
	Which one will the fountain bless?  Which one will the fountain bless?
Three coins in the fountain, through the ripples how they shine
Just one wish will be granted, one heart will wear a valentine.
	Make it mine! Make it mine! Make it mine!
	Make it mine! Make it mine! Make it mine!

THREE LITTLE BIRDS
	Don't worry about a thing, 'cause every little thing gonna be all right.
	Singin': "Don't worry about a thing, 'cause every little thing gonna be all right! "
Rise up this mornin', smile with the risin' sun, three little birds sit by my doorstep
Singin' sweet songs of melodies pure and true,
Sayin', "This is my message to you-ou-ou: "  (REPEAT THE SONG)

THREE LITTLE WORDS
Three little words, oh, what I'd give for that wonderful phrase
To hear those three little words, that's all I'd live for the rest of my days
	And what I feel in my heart they tell sincerely,
	No other words can tell it half so clearly.
Three little words, eight little letters which simply mean I love you.

THROUGH THE YEARS
I can't remember when you weren't there, when I didn't care for anyone but you
I swear we've been through everything there is, can't imagine anything we've missed
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do
   Through the years, you've never let me down, you've turned my life around
   The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you
   Through the years, I've never been afraid, I've loved the life we've made
   And I'm so glad I've stayed right here with you, through the years
I can't remember what I used to do, who I trusted, who I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know, can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me, I need you more and more
   Through the years, through all the good and bad, I know how much we had
   I've always been so glad to be with you
   Through the years, it's better every day, you've kissed my tears away
   As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you through the years

   Through the years, when everything went wrong, together we were strong
   I know that I belonged right here with you
   Through the years, I never had a doubt, we'd always work things out
   I've learned what love's about, by loving you through the years

   Through the years, you've never let me down, you've turned my life around
   The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you
   Through the years, it's better every day, you've kissed my tears away
   As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you through the years

TICKET TO RIDE
I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, yeah! The girl that's driving me mad is going away
She's got a ticket to ride, she's got a ticket to ride, she's got a ticket to ride, and she don't care.
She said that living with me is  bringing her down, yeah! She would never be free when I was around
She's got a ticket to ride, she's got a ticket to ride, she's got a  ticket to ride, and she don't care.
	I don't know why she's riding so high, she oughta think twice, she oughta do right by me
	Before she gets to saying goodbye, she oughta think twice, she oughta do right by me
I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, yeah! The girl that's driving me mad is going away
She's got a ticket to ride, she's got a ticket to ride, she's got a ticket to ride, and she don't care.
My baby don't care.  My baby don't care. My baby don't care

TIE  A YELLOW RIBBON
I'm comin' home, I've done my time. Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine
If you received my letter tellin' you I'd soon be free
Then you'll know just what to do if you still want me, if you still want me
	Tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
	It's been three long years, do you still want me
	If I don't see a ribbon 'round the old oak tree
	I'll stay on the bus, for-get about us, put the blame on me
	If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
Bus driver please look for me,  'cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see
I'm really still in prison and my love she holds the key
A simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free.   I wrote and told her please
Now the whole damn bus is cheering and I can't believe I see
A   hundred yellow ribbons 'round the old  oak tree......I'm comin' home
      Tie a ribbon 'round the old oak tree,  tie a ribbon 'round the old oak tree
      Tie a ribbon 'round the old oak tree

TIJUANA JAIL
We went one day about a month ago to have a little fun in Mexico
We ended up in a gambling spa where the liquor flowed and the dice were hot
	So here we are in the Tijuana Jail, ain't got no friends to go our bail
	So here we'll stay 'cause we can't pay. Just send our mail to the Tijuana Jail
I was shootin' dice, rakin' in the dough, and then I heard the whistle blow
We started to run when a man in blue said, Señor, come with me, 'cause I want you
	So here we are in the Tijuana Jail........
	So here we'll stay 'cause we can't pay. Just send our mail to the Tijuana Jail
Just five hundred dollars and they'll set us free, I couldn't raise a penny if you threatened me
I know five "hundred" don't sound like much, but just try to find somebody to touch
	So here we are in the Tijuana Jail........

'TIL I KISSED YA
Never felt like this until I kissed ya. How did I exist until I kissed ya.
Never had you on my mind, now you're there all the time.
Never knew what I missed til I kissed ya, uh-huh, I kissed ya, whoaa yeah.
Things have really changed since I kissed ya, uh-huh.
My life's not the same now that I kissed ya, oh yeah.
    Mmm, ya got a way about ya, now I can't live without ya.
Never knew what I missed til I kissed ya, uh-huh, I kissed ya, whoaa yeah.
	You don't realize what you do to me. And I didn't realize what a kiss could be.
    Mmm, ya got a way about ya, now I can't live without ya.
Never knew what I missed til I kissed ya,     uh-huh, I kissed ya,        oh yeah.
	You don't realize what you do to me. And I didn't realize what a kiss could be.
   Mmm, ya got a way about ya, now I can't live without ya.
Never knew what I missed til I kissed ya,     uh-huh, I kissed ya, oh yeah.
I kissed ya, whoaa yeah..I kissed ya,   uh-huh..I KISSED YA!

TILL
Till the moon deserts the sky, till all the seas run dry, till then I'll worship you
Till the tropic sun grows cold, till this young world grows old, my darling, I'll adore you
	You are my reason to live, all I own I would give, just to have you adore me
Till the rivers flow upstream, till lovers cease to dream, till then I'm yours, be mine
	You are my reason to live, all I own I would give, just to have you adore me
Till the rivers flow upstream, till lovers cease to dream, till then I'm yours, be mine

TILL THEN
Till then, my darling, please wait for me, till then, no matter when it will be
Some day, I know I'll be back again, please wait, till then
Our dreams will live though we are apart, our love, I know it'll keep in our hearts
Till then, when of the world will be free, please wait for me
	Although there are oceans we must cross, and mountains that we must climb
	I know every gain must have a loss, so pray that our loss is nothing but time
Till then, let's dream of what there will be, till then, we'll call on each memory
Till then, when I will hold you again, please wait till then

TILL THE END OF THE DAY
Baby, I feel good, from the moment I arise
Feel good from mornin' till the end of the day, till the end of the day

Yeah, you and me, we live this life, from when we get up, till we go sleep at night
	You and me, we're free, we do as we please, yeah
	From mornin', till the end of the day, till the end of the day
Yeah, I get up, and I see the sun up, and I feel good, yeah, 'cause my life has begun
	You and me, we're free, we do as we please, yeah
	From mornin', till the end of the day, till the end of the day
	Till the end of the day, till the end of the day

	You and me, we're free, we do as we please, yeah
	From mornin', till the end of the day, till the end of the day
	Till the end of the day, till the end of the day
	Till the end of the day, till the end of the day

TILL THERE WAS YOU
There were bells on the hill, but I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all Till There Was You
There were birds in the sky but I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all Till There Was You
And there was music and there were wonderful roses, they tell me
In sweet fragrant meadows of dawn, and dew,
There was love all around, but I never heard it singing,
No, I never heard it at all Till There Was You.

TILL WE MEET AGAIN
　　　　There's a song in the land of the lily, each sweetheart has heard with a sigh.
	Over high garden walls this sweet echo falls, as a soldier boy whispers goodbye....
Smile the while you kiss me sad adieu. When the clouds roll by I'll come to you.
Then the skies will seem more blue, down in Lover's Lane, my dearie.

Wedding bells will ring so merrily, every tear will be a memory.
So, wait and pray each night for me, till we meet again.

TIME AFTER TIME
Time after time, I tell myself that I'm so lucky to be loving you.
So lucky to be the one you run to see, in the evening when the day is through
I only know what I know, the passing years will show you've kept my love so young, so new
And time after time, you'll hear me say that I'm so lucky to be loving you.

TIME IN A BOTTLE
If I could save time in a bottle, the first thing that I'd like to do
Is to save every day till eternity passes away, just to spend them with you

If I could make days last forever, if words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then, again, I would spend them with you
	But there never seems to be enough time
	To do the things you want to do, once you find them
	I've looked around enough to know
	That you're the one I want to go through time with
If I had a box just for wishes, and dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty, except for the memory of how they were answered by you
	But there never seems to be enough time
	To do the things you want to do, once you find them
	I've looked around enough to know
	That you're the one I want to go through time with

TIME OF THE SEASON
It's the time of the season, when love runs high
And this time, give it to me easy, and let me try, with pleasured hands
(To take you in the sun to) promised lands, (to show you every one)
It's the time of the season for loving

What's your name? Who's your daddy? (He rich) Is he rich like me?
Has he taken any time (any time, to show) to show you what you need to live
(Tell it to me slowly) tell you what (I really want to know)
It's the time of the season for loving

What's your name? Who's your daddy? (He rich) Is he rich like me?
Has he taken any time (any time, to show) to show you what you need to live
(Tell it to me slowly) tell you what (I really want to know)
It's the time of the season for loving

TIME OF YOUR LIFE
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
     So make the best of this test and don't ask why
     It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
	It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
	I hope you had the time of your life
So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
     Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
     For what it's worth it was worth all the while
	It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
	I hope you had the time of your life

TIME ON MY HANDS
Time on my hands, you in my arms, nothing but love in view
Then if you fall, once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare, with someone you care for, one love affair for two
And so, with time on my hands, and you in my arms, and love in my heart all for you


THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN'
Come gather 'round people where ever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone. If your time to you is worth savin',
     Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone, for the times they are a-changin'!
Come writers and critics who prophesy with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin, and there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
     For the loser now will be later to win, for the times they are a' a-changin'!
Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled. There's a battle outside and it's ragin'
     It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls, for the times they are a-changin'!
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize if you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command. Your old road is rapidly agin'
     Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand, for the times they are a-changin'!
The line it is drawn the curse it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past, the order is rapidly fadin'
     And the first one now will later be last, for the times they are a-changin'!

TINY BUBBLES
Tiny bubbles in the wine make me happy, make me feel fine
Tiny bubbles make me warm all over
With a feelin' that I'm gonna love you till the end of time
	So, here's to that golden moon and here's to the silver sea
	And mostly here's a toast to you and me.
("Tiny bubbles")
	So, here's to that ginger lei I give to you today
	And here's a kiss that will not fade away.
("Tiny bubbles")

TIPTOE THROUGH THE TULIPS
Tiptoe to the window, by the window that is where I'll be
Come tiptoe through the tulips with me
Tiptoe from your pillow to the shadow of a willow tree
Come tiptoe through the tulips with me.
Knee deep in flowers we'll stray
We'll keep the showers away, and if I
Kiss you in the garden, in the moonlight, will you pardon me?
Come tiptoe through the tulips with me.

TIRED OF WAITING FOR YOU
	I'm so tired, tired of waitin', tired of waitin' for you
	I'm so tired, tired of waitin', tired of waitin' for you
I was a lonely soul, I had nobody till I met you
But you keep-a  me waitin' all of the time, what can I do?
     It's your life, and you can do what you want
     Do what you like, but please don't keep-a me waitin', please don't keep-a me waitin'
	'Cause I'm so tired, tired of waitin', tired of waitin' for you
	So tired, tired of waitin', tired of waitin' for you
I was a lonely soul, I had nobody till I met you
But you keep-a  me waitin' all of the time, what can I do?
     It's your life, and you can do what you want
     Do what you like, but please don't keep-a me waitin', please don't keep-a me waitin'
	'Cause I'm so tired, tired of waitin', tired of waitin' for you
	So tired, tired of waitin', tired of waitin' for you, for you, for you

'TIS AUTUMN
Old Father time checked, so there'd be no doubt, called on the North wind to come on out,
Then cupped his hands, so proudly to shout, "La-di-dah di-dah-di-dum, 'Tis Autumn!"

Trees say they're tired, they've born too much fruit, charmed all the wayside, there's no dispute.
Now shedding leaves, they don't give a hoot, La-di-dah di-dah-di-dum, 'Tis Autumn!
Then the birds got together to chirp about the weather,  mmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.
	After makin' their decision, in birdie-like precision,
	Turned about, and made a beeline to the south.
My holding you close really is no crime, ask the birds, the trees and old Father Time.
It's just to help the mercury climb. La-di-dah di-dah-di-dum, 'Tis Autumn!
It's just to help the mercury climb. La-di-dah di-dah-di-dum, 'Tis Autumn!

TODAY WHILE THE BLOSSOMS STILL CLING TO THE VINE
	Today while the blossoms still cling to the vine,
	I'll taste your strawberries, I'll drink your sweet wine;
	A million tomorrows shall all pass away
	Ere I forget all the joy that is mine today.
I'll be a dandy and I'll be a rover,
You'll know who I am by the song that I sing.
I'll feast at your table, I'll sleep in your clover,
Who cares what tomorrow may bring.
	Chorus
I can't be contented with yesterday's glories,
I can't live on promises winter to spring.
Today is my moment and now is my story --
I'll laugh and I'll cry and I'll sing.
	Chorus

TO EACH HIS OWN
A rose must remain with the sun and the rain, or its lovely promise won't come true
To each his own, to each his own, and my own is you

What good is a song if the words just don't belong, and a dream must be a dream for two
No good alone, to each his own, for me there's you
	If a flame is to grow, there must be a glow, to open each door there's a key
	I need you, I know, I can't let you go, your touch means too much to me
Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed, or they'll never know what love can do
To each his own, I've found my own, one and only you

TO KNOW HIM IS TO LOVE HIM
To know, know, know her/him is to love, love, love her/him
Just to see her/him smile, makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know her/him is to love, love, love her/him
And I do (And I do, and I, and I do and I)

I'd be good to her/him, I'd bring love to her/him
Everyone says there'll come a day, when I'll walk along side of her/him

Yes, yes, to know her/him is to love, love, love her/him
And I do (And I do, and I, and I do, and I, and I do, and I)
	Why can't she/he see, how blind can she/he be
	Someday she/he will see that she/he was meant for me, oh, oh yes
To know, know, know her/him is to love, love, love her/him
Just to see her/him smile, makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know her/him is to love, love, love her/him
And I do (And I do, and I, and I do, and I, and I do, and I do)

TO LOVE SOMEBODY
There's a light, a certain kind of light, that never shone on me
I want my life to be lived with you, lived with you
There's a way, everybody say, to do each and every little thing
But what does it bring if I ain't got you, ain't got? Baby,
	You don't know what it's like, baby, you don't know what it's like
	To love somebody, to love somebody, the way I love you
In my brain, I see your face again, I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind, and I'm blind, so so sorrily blind
I'm a man, can't you see what I am, I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do if I ain't got you, ain't got? Baby,
	You don't know what it's like, baby, you don't know what it's like
	To love somebody, to love somebody, the way I love you. Oh...........

	You don't know what it's like, baby, you don't know what it's like
	To love somebody, to love somebody, the way I love you
	To love somebody, to love somebody, the way I love you

TONIGHT YOU BELONG TO ME
I know (I know) you belong to somebody new, but tonight you belong to me.
Although (although) we're apart, you're part of my heart, and tonight you belong to me.
	Way down (way down) by the stream, how very very sweet it will seem
	Once more just to dream by the silvery moonlight, my honey
I know (I know) with the dawn that you will be gone
But tonight you belong to me.

TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT
Be wise, be smart, behave, my heart, don't give up your cart when she's so close
Be soft, be sweet, but be discreet, don't go off your beat, she's too close for comfort
	Too close, too close for comfort, please, not again.
	Too close, too close to know just when to say when.
Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware, on your guard, take care, while there's such temptation
 	One thing leads to another, too late to run for cover, she's much too close for comfort now!

TOO LATE TO TURN BACK NOW
My mama told me, she said, "Son, please beware
There's this thing called love, and it's a-everywhere"
And she told me it can break your heart, and put you in misery
Since I met this little woman, I feel it's happened to me, and I'm tellin' you
	It's too late to turn back now, I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
	It's too late to turn back now, I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
I find myself phoning her at least ten times a day
It's so unusual for me to carry on this way
I tell you, I can't sleep at night, a-wanting to hold her tight
I tried so hard to convince myself that this feelin' just can't be right, and I'm tellin' you
	It's too late to turn back now, I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
	It's too late to turn back now, I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
	(It's too late to turn back now, I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love)
	(It's too late to turn back now, I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love)
     I wouldn't mind it if I knew she really loved me too
     But I'd hate to think that I'm in love alone, and there's nothing that I can do, oh
	It's too late to turn back now, I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
	It's too late to turn back now, I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love

TOO MARVELOUS
You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words,
Like "glorious," "glamorous," and that old standby "amorous."
You're just too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough.
	You're much "too much" and just too "very, very"
	To ever be in Webster's Dictionary.
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for all those words.

TOO MUCH
Honey, I love you too much, eed your lovin' too much
Want the thrill of your touch. Gee, I can't hold you too much
You do all the livin' while I do all the givin'
	Cause I love you too much
You spend all my money too much, have to share you honey, too much
When I want some lovin', you're gone. Don't you know you're treatin' me wrong
Now you got me started, don't you leave me broken hearted
	Cause I love you too much
Ev'ry time I kiss your sweet lips, I can feel my heart go flip flip
I'm such a fool for your charms, take me back baby in your arms
Like to hear you sighin', even though I know you're lyin'
	Cause I love you too much
Need your lovin' all the time. Need you huggin', please be mine
Need you near me, stay real close. Please, please, hear me, you're the most
Now you got me started, don't you leave me broken hearted
	Cause I love you too much

TOO YOUNG
They try to tell us we're too young, too young to really be in love
They say that love's a word, a word we've only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of
And yet we're not too young to know, this love will last, though years may go
And then some day they may recall, we were not too young at all.  (X2)

MONA LISA
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you; you're so like the lady with the mystic smile.
Is it only 'cause you're lonely men have blamed you for that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa, or is this the way you hide a broken heart?
	Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep; they just lie there, and they die there.
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa, or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art. (X2)
	Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa.

TOP HAT, WHITE TIE AND TAILS
I'm puttin' on my top hat, tyin' up my white tie, brushin' off my tails
I'm dudein' up my shirt front, puttin' in the shirt studs, polishin' my nails
I'm steppin' out, my dear to breathe an at-mosphere that simply reeks with class
And I trust that you'll excuse my dust when I step on the gas for I'll be
There, puttin' down my top hat, mussin' up my white tie, dancin' in my tails

TOP OF THE WORLD
Such a feelin's comin' over me; there is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes, and I won't be surprised if it's a dream
Everything I want the world to be is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
	I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
	And the only explanation I can find
	Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
	Your love's put me at the top of the world
Something in the wind has learned my name, and it's tellin' me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze. There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me

There is only one wish on my mind, when this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me. All I need will be mine if you are here
	CHORUS

TOSSIN' AND TURNIN'
	Baby, baby, you did something to me!
I couldn't sleep at all last night, just a-thinkin' of you, baby, things weren't right
Well, I was tossin' and turnin', turnin' and tossin', I tossed and I turned all night

I kicked the blankets on the floor, turned my pillow upside-down, I never, never did before,
'Cause I was tossin' and turnin', turnin' and tossin', I tossed and I turned all night
    Jumped out of bed, turned on the light, I pulled down the shade, went to the kitchen for a bite
    Rolled up the shade, turned off the light, I jumped back into bed, it was the middle of the night
The clock downstairs was striking four, couldn't get you off my mind, I met the milkman at the door,
'Cause I was tossin' and turnin', turnin' and tossin', I tossed and I turned all night
    Jumped out of bed, turned on the light, I pulled down the shade, went to the kitchen for a bite
    Rolled up the shade, turned off the light, I jumped back into bed, it was the middle of the night
The clock downstairs was striking four, I couldn't get you off my mind, I met the milkman at the door,
'Cause I was tossin' and turnin', turnin' and tossin', I tossed and I turned all night
Yay, yay, yay, I was tossin' and turnin', turnin' and tossin', I tossed and I turned all night!

THE TOUCH OF YOUR LIPS
The touch of your lips upon my brow, your lips that are cool and sweet,
Such tenderness lies in their soft caress, my heart forgets to beat.

The touch of your hands upon my head, the love in your eyes a-shine,
And now, at last, the moment divine, the touch of your lips on mine.

And now, at last, the moment divine, the touch of your lips on mine.
The touch of your lips, the look in your eyes, the touch of your lips on mine.

TOWN WITHOUT PITY
When you're young and so in love as we, and bewildered by the world we see,
Why do people hurt us so, only those in love would know, what a town without pity can do
If we stop to gaze upon a star, people talk about how bad we are,
Ours is not an easy age, we're like tigers in a cage, what a town without pity can do.
	The young have problems, many problems, we need an understanding heart.
	Why don't they help us, try to help us, before this clay and granite planet falls apart.
Take these eager lips and hold me fast, I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last.
How can we keep love alive, how can anything survive, when these little minds tear you in two,
What a town without pity can do.

How can we keep love alive, how can anything survive, when these little minds tear you in two,
What a town without pity can do. No it isn't very pretty what a town without pity can do.

TOYLAND
Toyland, toyland, little girl and boy land,
While you dwell within it, you are ever happy there

Childhood joy land, mystic, merry toyland.
Once you pass its borders, you can never return again
	When you've grown up, my dears, and are as old as I
	You'll laugh and ponder on the years
	That roll so swiftly by, my dears, that roll so swiftly by
Once you pass its borders, you can never return again
Once you pass its borders, you can never return again.

TRACES
Faded photographs, covered now with lines and creases,
Tickets torn in half, memories in bits and pieces...
Traces of love, long ago, that didn't work out right..Traces of love.

Ribbons from her hair, souvenirs of days together.
The ring she used to wear, pages from an old love letter.
Traces of love, long ago, that didn't work out right,
Traces of love....with me, tonight.
	I close my eyes...and say a prayer,
	That in her heart she'll find a trace of love still there...somewhere
Traces of hope...in the night,that she'll come back and dry
These, traces of tears, from my eyes.

TRACKS OF MY TEARS
People say I'm the life of the party, 'cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty, deep inside I'm blue
	So take a good look at my face, you know my smile looks out of place
	If you look closer, it's easy to trace the tracks of my tears
	Whoa oh, I need you, need you
Since you left me, if you see me with another girl, lookin' like I'm having fun
Although she might be cute, she's just a substitute, because you're the permanent one
	So take a good look at my face, you know my smile looks out of place
	If you look closer, it's easy to trace the tracks of my tears, whoa oh!
(Outside) I'm masquerading, (inside) my hope is fading
(I'm just a clown) well, since you put me down
My smile is my make-up I wear since my break-up with you
	Baby, take a good look at my face, you know my smile looks out of place
	If you look closer, it's easy to trace the tracks of my tears

	Oh, baby, take a good look at my face, you know my smile looks out of place
	If you look closer, it's easy to trace the tracks of my tears

TRAINS AND BOATS AND PLANES
Trains and boats and planes are passing by, they mean a trip to Paris or Rome
For someone else, but not for me, the trains and the boats and planes
Took you away, away from me

We were so in love, and high above we had a star to wish upon wish
And dreams come true, but not for me, the trains and the boats and planes
Took you away, away from me
	You are from another part of the world,
	You had to go back a while, and then you said you soon would return again
	I'm waiting here like I promised to, I'm waiting here, but where are you?
Trains and boats and planes took you away, but every time I see them I pray
And if my prayer can cross the sea, the trains and the boats and planes
Will bring you back, back home to me

The trains and the boats and planes will bring you back, back home to me

TRAVELIN' MAN
I'm a travelin' man, I've made a lot of stops all over the world
And in every port I own the heart of at least one lovely girl
I've a pretty senorita waiting for me down in old Mexico
If you're ever in Alaska stop and see my cute little Eskimo
Oh, my sweet Fraulein down in Berlin town makes my heart start to yearn
And my China doll down in old Hong Kong waits for my return
Pretty Polynesian baby over the sea, I remember the night
When we walked in the sands of the Waikiki and I held you oh so tight.
Oh, I'm a travelin' man, yeah, I'm a travelin' man, oh, I'm a travelin' man

TREAT ME NICE
When I walk through that door, baby, be polite,
You're gonna make me sore, if you don't greet me right
Don't you ever kiss me once, kiss me twice....treat me nice

I know that you've been told it's not fair to tease
So if you come on cold, I'm really gonna freeze
If you don't want me to be cold as ice.....treat me nice

	Make me feel at home, if you really care
	Scratch my back and run your pretty fingers through my hair
	You know I'll be your slave, if you ask me to
	But if you don't behave, I'll walk right out on you
	If you want my love then take my advice....treat me nice

	Make me feel at home, if you really care
	Scratch my back and run your pretty fingers through my hair
	You know I'll be your slave, if you ask me to
	But if you don't behave, I'll walk right out on you
	If you want my love then take my advice....treat me nice, treat me nice
	If you really want my lovin', treat me nice

TRISTE
Sad is to live in solitude, far from your tranquil altitude
Sad is to know that no one ever can live on a dream
That never can be, will never be. Dreamer wake up, wake up and see

Your beauty is an aeroplane, so high my heart can`t bear the strain
A heart that stops when you pass by, only to cause me pain. Sad is to live in solitude

Your beauty is an aeroplane, so high my heart can`t bear the strain
A heart that stops when you pass by, only to cause me pain. Sad is to live in solitude

TRUE LOVE
Suntanned, windblown, honeymooners at last alone
Feeling far above par, oh, how lucky we are

While I give to you and you give to me, true love, true love
So on and on it will always be, true love, true love
	For you and I have a guardian angel on high, with nothing to do
But to give to you and to give to me, love forever true
	For you and I have a guardian angel on high, with nothing to do
But to give to you and to give to me, love forever true, love forever true

TRY A LITTLE KINDNESS
If you see your brother standing by the road, with a heavy load, from the seeds he's sowed
And if you see your sister falling by the way, just stop and say, you're going the wrong way
You've got to try a little kindness, yes, show a little kindness
Just shine your light for everyone to see
And if you try a little kindness, then you'll overlook the blindness
Of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets
Don't walk around the down and out, lend a helping hand, instead of doubt
And the kindness that you show every day will help someone along their way
You've got to try a little kindness, yes, show a little kindness
Just shine your light for everyone to see
And if you try a little kindness, then you'll overlook the blindness
Of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets

TRY A LITTLE TENDERNESS
She may be weary, women do get weary wearing the same shabby dress
And when she's weary, try a little tenderness.
You know she's waiting, just anticipating things she may never possess
While she's without them, try a little tenderness.
It's not just sentimental, she has her grief and care
And a word that's soft and gentle, makes it easier to bear.
You won't regret it, women don't forget it, love is their whole happiness
It's all so easy try a little tenderness (X2)

TRYIN' TO  GET THE FEELING AGAIN
Doctor, my woman is comin' back home late today, could you maybe give me something?
'Cause the feelin' is gone, and I must get it back right away, before she sees that I've been
     Up, down, tryin' to get the feelin' again, all around, tryin' to get the feelin' again
     The one that made me shiver, made my knees start to quiver, every-time she walked in
     And I've looked high, low, everywhere I possibly can, but there's no tryin' to get the feelin' again
     It seemed to disappear as fast as it came
Where did it run to? I thought I'd done all that I could, just to keep the love-light burnin'
But, whatever I've done, I guess I just haven't done it too good, 'cause all that's left is yearnin'
     I've been up, down, tryin' to get the feelin' again, all around, tryin' to get the feelin' again
     The one that made me shiver, made my knees start to quiver, every-time she walked in
     And I've looked high, low, everywhere I possibly can, but there's no tryin' to get the feelin' again
     It seemed to disappear as fast as it came, and I've been  lookin, I've been lookin', I've been lookin'
     Up and down, and tryin' to get the feelin', I've been up, I've been down
I've been tryin' to get the feelin' again, I'm gonna get  that feelin', I'm gonna get  that feelin',
I've got to get  that feelin', I've been tryin' to get the feelin' again.

TRY TO REMEMBER
Try to remember the kind of September when life was slow and oh, so mellow.
Try to remember the kind of September when grass was green and grain was yellow.
Try to remember the kind of September when you were a tender and callow fellow,
Try to remember and if you remember the follow.
	Try to remember when life was so tender that no one wept except the willow.
	Try to remember when life was so tender that dreams were kept beside your pillow.
	Try to remember when life was so tender that love was an ember about to billow.
	Try to remember and if you remember then follow.
Deep in December it's nice to remember although you know the snow will follow.
Deep in December it's nice to remember without the hurt the heart is hollow.
Deep in December it's nice to remember the fire of September that made us mellow.
Deep in December our hearts should remember and follow.

TUMBLIN' TUMBLEWEEDS
See them tumblin' down, pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found drifting along with the tumblin' tumbleweeds
Cares of the past are behind, nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind, drifting along with the tumblin' tumbleweeds
I know when night is gone that a new  world's born at dawn
I'll keep rolling along, deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong, drifting along with the tumblin' tumbleweeds
Drifting along with the tumblin' tumbleweeds

TURN AROUND
Where are you going, my little one, little one, where are you going, my baby, my own?
Turn around and you're two, turn around and you're four,
Turn around and you're a young girl going out of my door.
Turn around, turn around, turn around and you're a young girl going out of the door.

Where are you going, my little one, little one,
In pigtails and petticoats, where have you gone?2
Turn around and you're tiny, turn around and you're grown,
Turn around and you're a young wife with babes of your own.
Turn around, turn around, turn around and you're a young wife with babes of your own.

TURN AROUND, LOOK AT ME
There is someone walking behind you, turn around, look at me
There is someone watching your footsteps, turn around, look at me
	There is someone who really needs you, here's my heart in my hand
	Turn around, look at me, understand, understand
That there's someone who'll stand beside you, turn around, look at me
And there's someone to love and guide you, turn around, look at me
	Oh, I've waited, but I'll wait forever for you to come to me
	Look at someone who really loves you, turn around, look at me
	Turn around, look at me

TURN DOWN THE LIGHTS
I've been up, I've been down, I've been so turned around
That I've seen my fate in the eyes of others
I've been high, I've been low, but there's one thing I know
There's a lot to give, when we give to each other
So I bring you my song, hoping you'll sing along
	Turn down the lights, turn up the music.
	Let's just be together to-night, and turn down the lights
First we're here, then we're gone, but the music plays on
From the heart of one, to the heart of another
It's good-night, not good-bye, we're just done for awhile
We'll be back again with some new things discovered
　　　　And we'll bring you our song, hoping you'll sing along
	Turn down the lights, turn up the music.
	Let's just  be together tonight, come turn down the lights
So I bring you my song, hoping you'll sing along
	Turn down the lights, turn up the music.
	Let's just be together tonight,
Turn up the love, bring out the memories,
You and I could share them all night
　　　　So turn down the lights,  turn down the lights,
Turn down the lights, turn down the lights

TURN, TURN, TURN
	To everything (Turn, Turn, Turn), there is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
	And a time for every purpose, under Heaven
A time to be born, a time to die, a time to plant, a time to reap
A time to kill, a time to heal, a time to laugh, a time to weep
	To everything....
A time to build up, a time to break down, a time to dance, a time to mourn
A time to cast away stones, a time to gather stones together
	To everything....
A time of love, a time of hate, a time of war, a time of peace
A time you may embrace, a time to refrain from embracing
	To everything....
A time to gain, a time to lose, a time to rend, a time to sew
A time to love, a time to hate, a time for peace, I swear it's not too late
	To everything....

THE TWELFTH OF NEVER
You ask how much I need you, must I explain?
I need you, oh my darling, like roses need rain.
You ask how long I'll love you; I'll tell you true:
Until the twelfth of never, I'll still be loving you.
	Hold me close, never let me go.
	Hold me close, melt my heart like April snow.
I'll love you till the bluebells forget to bloom;
I'll love you till the clover has lost its perfume.
I'll love you till the poets run out of rhyme,
Until the twelfth of never and that's a long, long time.
Until the twelfth of never and that's a long, long time.

TWENTY-FOUR HOURS FROM TULSA
Dearest darling, I had to write to say that I won't be home any more
For something happened to me while I was driving home and I'm not the same any more
	Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa. ah, only one day away from your arms
	I saw a welcoming light, and stopped to rest for the night
And that is when I saw her, as I pulled in outside of the small hotel, she was there
And so I walked up to her, asked where I could get something to eat and she showed me where
	Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa. ah, only one day away from your arms
	She took me to the café, I asked her if she would stay, she said, "Okay"
  Instrumental verse
	Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa. ah, only one day away from your arms
	The jukebox started to play, and night time turned into day
As we were dancing closely, all of a sudden I lost control, as I held her charms
And I caressed her, kissed her, told her I'd die before I would let her out of my arms
	Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa. ah, only one day away from your arms
	I hate to do this to you, but I love somebody new. What can I do?
	When I can never, never, never go home again?

25 OR 6 TO 4
Waiting for the break of day, searching for something to say
Flashing lights against the sky, giving up, I close my eyes
Sitting cross-legged on the floor, 25 or 6 to 4

Staring blindly into space, getting up to splash my face
Wanting just to stay awake, wondering how much I can take
Should I try to do some more, 25 or 6 to 4

Feeling like I ought to sleep, spinning room is sinking deep
Searching for something to say, waiting for the break of day
25 or 6 to 4, 25 or 6 to 4

26 MILES (SANTA CATALINA)
	Twenty- six miles a-cross the sea, Santa Cata-lina is a-waitin' for me
	Santa Cata-lina, the island of ro-mance, ro-mance, ro-mance, ro-mance
Water all around it everywhere, tropical trees and the salty air
But for me the thing that's a-waitin' there....romance

It seems so distant, twenty-six miles away, restin' in the water serene
I'd work for anyone, even the Navy who would float me to my island dream

Twenty- six miles, so near yet far, I'd swim with just some water-wings and my guitar
I could leave the wings but I'll need the guitar for romance, romance, romance, romance
	chorus
A tropical heaven out in the ocean, covered with trees and girls
If I have to swim, I'll do it forever, till I'm gazin' on those island pearls

Forty kilometers in a leaky old boat, any old thing that'll stay afloat
When we arrive we'll all promote romance, romance, romance, romance
	chorus

TWILIGHT TIME
Heavenly shades of night are falling, it's twilight time
Out of the mist your voice is calling, it's twilight time
When purple colored curtains mark the end of the day
I hear you, my dear, at twilight time

Deepening shadows gather splendor, as day is done
Fingers of night will soon surrender, the setting sun
I count the moments darling till you're here with me
Together at last at twilight time
	Here in the after-glow of day we keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
	Here in the sweet and same old way, I fall in love again as I did then
Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me, like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me with dreams untold
Each day I pray for evening just to be with you
Together at last at twilight time
Together at last at twilight time

TWISTIN' THE NIGHT AWAY
Let me tell you 'bout a place, somewhere up a-New York way
Where the people are so gay, twistin' the night away
Here they have a lot of fun, puttin' trouble on the run
Man, you find the old and young, twistin' the night away
	They're twistin', twistin', everybody's feelin' great,
	They're twistin', twistin', they're twistin' the night away
Here's a man in evenin' clothes, how he got here, I don't know
But, man, you oughta see him go, twistin' the night away
He's dancin' with the chick in slacks, she's movin' up and back
Aw, man, there ain't nothin' like twistin' the night away
	They're twistin', twistin', everybody's feelin' great,
	They're twistin', twistin', they're twistin' the night away
Here's a fellow in blue jeans, dancin' with an older queen
Who's dolled up in diamond rings, and twistin' the night away
Man, you oughta see her go, twistin' to the rock and roll,
Here you find the young and old, twistin' the night away

TWO BROTHERS
Two brothers on their way, two brothers on their way
Two brothers on their way, one wore blue, and one  wore gray
On wore blue and one wore gray, as they marched along their way
The fife and drum began to play, all on a beautiful morning.

One was gentle, one was kind, one was gentle, one was kind
One came home, one stayed behind, a cannonball don't pay no mind
A cannonball don't pay no mind if your gentle or if you're kind
It don't think of the folks behind, all on a beautiful morning.

Two girls waitin' by the railroad track, two girls waitin' by the railroad track
Two girls waitin' by the railroad track, one wore blue, and one wore black
One wore blue, and one wore black, waitin' by the railroad track
For their darlings to come back, ALL ON A BEAUTIFUL MORNING.

TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS
	Nothing matters if I am yours and you are mine
Two different worlds, we live in two different worlds,
For we've been told that a love like ours could never be

So far apart, they say we're so far apart
And that we haven't the right to change our destiny
	When will they learn that a heart doesn't draw a line
	Nothing matters if I am yours and you are mine
Two different worlds, we live in two different worlds
But we will show them, as we walk together in the sun
That our two different worlds are one
	Two different worlds, we live in two different worlds
	But we will show them, as we walk together in the sun
	That our two different worlds are one, are one, are one!

TWO FOR THE ROAD
If you're feeling fancy free, come wander through the world with me,
And any place we chance to be will be our rendezvous.
Two for the road, we'll travel down the years, collecting precious memories,
Selecting souvenirs, and living life the way we please.
In the summertime the sun will shine, in winter we'll drink summer wine,
And every day that you are mine, will be a lovely day.
As long as love still wears a smile, I know that we'll be two for the road,
And that's a long long while.

TWO LOVERS
       	Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed, two lovers, and I love them both the same
Let me tell you 'bout my first lover: She's/he's sweet and kind, she's/he's mine all mine
She/he treats me good, like a lover should,
And makes me love her/him, I really, really love her/him
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I love her so, and I'll do everything I can to let her/him know
      	 But  I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed, two lovers, and I love them both the same
Let me tell you 'bout my other lover, you know, she/he treats me bad, she/he makes me sad
She/he makes me cry, but still, I can't deny that I love her/him, I really, really love her/him
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I love her so, and I'll do everything I can to let her know
Oh, but, darling, well, don't you know that I can tell
Whenever I look at you, that you think that I'm untrue
'Cause I said that I love two, but I really, really do
'Cause you're a split personality, and, in reality, both of them are you
      	 But  I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed, two lovers, and I love them both the same
      	 But  I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed, 'cause both of them are you
      	 But  I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed, two lovers, and I love them both the same
      	 But  I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed, 'cause both of them are you

TWO SLEEPY PEOPLE
Here we are, out of cigarettes, holding hands and yawning, look how late it gets
Two sleepy people, by dawn's early light, and too much in love to say "Goodnight."
Here we are, in the cozy chair, picking on a wish-bone from the Frigidaire,
Two sleepy people with nothing to say, and too much in love to break away.
	Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall? Father didn't like you at all.
	Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall?
	To rent this little nest, and get a bit of rest.
Well, here we are, just about the same, foggy little fella, drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people, by dawn's early light, and too much in love to say "Goodnight."

UNDECIDED
First you say you do and then you don't, and then you say you will and then you won't
You're undecided now so what are you gonna do?
Now you want to play and then it's no,   and  when you say you'll stay that's when you go
You're undecided now so what are you gonna do?
	I've been sitting on a fence, and it doesn't make much sense
	'Cause you keep me in suspense and you know it
	Then you promise to return when you don't I really burn
	Well, I guess I'll never learn and I show it
If you've got a heart and if you're kind  then  don't keep us apart make up your mind
You're undecided now so what are you gonna do?

UNDER PARIS SKIES
Stranger beware, there's love in the air under Paris skies
Try to be smart and don't let your heart catch on fire.
Love becomes king, the moment it's spring under Paris skies
Lonely hearts meet somewhere on the street of desire.
Parisian love can bloom, high in a skylight room
Or in a gay café where hundreds of people can see.
I wasn't smart and I lost my heart under Paris skies
Don't ever be a heartbroken stranger like me.
Oh, I fell in love.  Yes, I was a fool,  for Paris can be so beautifully cruel
Paris is just a gay coquette, who wants to love and then forget.
Stranger, beware, there's love in the air.
Just look and see what happened to me under Paris skies
Watch what you do, the same thing can happen to you.

UNDER THE BOARDWALK
Oh, when the sun beats down and burns the tar upon the roof
And your shoes get so hot you wish your tired feet were fire-proof
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea...yeah
On a blanket with my baby, that's where I'll be
	UTBW, out of the sun, UTBW, we'll be havin' some fun, UTBW people walkin' above
	UTBW, we'll be fallin' in love, under the boardwalk, boardwalk
From the park you hear the happy sound of a carousel
You can almost taste the hot dogs and french fries they sell
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea...yeah
On a blanket with my baby, that's where I'll be
	UTBW, out of the sun, UTBW, we'll be havin' some fun, UTBW people walkin' above
	UTBW, we'll be fallin' in love, under the boardwalk, boardwalk

UNFORGETTABLE
Unforgettable, that's what you are, unforgettable, though near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me, how the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more...
Unforgettable, in every way,  and forevermore, that's how you'll stay
That's why, darling, it's incredible, that someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too.

UNITED WE STAND
There's nowhere in the world that I would rather be, than with you my love
And there's nothing in the world that I would rather see, than your smile, my love
	For united we stand, divided we fall, and if our backs should ever be against the wall
	We'll be together, together, you and I  (repeat chorus)
And if the world around you falls apart my love, then I'll still be here
And if the going gets too hard along the way, just you call, I'll hear
	For united we stand, divided we fall, and if our backs should ever be against the wall
	We'll be together, together, you and I  (repeat chorus)

UNTIL IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO
You're not a dream, you're not an angel, you're a woman/man
I'm not a king/queen, I'm a man/woman, take my hand
We'll make a space in the lives that we'd planned
And here we'll stay until it's time for you to go

Yes, we're different worlds apart, we're not the same
We laughed and played at the start like in a game
You could have stayed outside my heart but in you came
And here you'll stay until it's time for you to go
	Don't ask why. Don't ask how.
	Don't ask forever. Love me now.
This love of mine had no beginning, it has no end
I was an oak, now I'm a willow, now I can bend
And, though I'll never in my life see you again
Still, I'll stay until it's time for you to go
	Don't ask why of me. Don't ask how of me
            Don't ask forever of me. Love me, love me now
You're not a dream, you're not an angel, you're a woman/man
I'm not a king/queen, I'm a man/woman, take my hand
We'll make a space in the lives that we'd planned
And here we'll stay until it's time for you to go
And here we'll stay until it's time for you to go

UNTIL THE REAL THING COMES ALONG
I'd work for you, I'd slave for you, I'd be a beggar or a knave for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do, until the real thing comes along
I'd gladly move the earth for you, to prove my love, dear, and its worth to you
If that isn't love, it will have to do, until the real thing comes along
	With all the words, dear, at my command, I just can't make you understand
	I'll always love you, darling, come what may, my heart is yours, what more can I say?
I'd sigh for you, I'd cry for you, I'd tear the stars down from the sky for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do, until the real thing comes along

UNTIL YOU COME BACK TO ME
Though you don't call anymore, I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door, tap on your window-pane
I want to tell you, baby, changes that I'm going through, missing you
	'Til you come back to me, that's what I'm gonna do
Why did you have to decide you had to set me free

I'm gonna swallow my pride, gonna beg you to please see me
I'm gonna walk  by myself to prove that my love is true, all for you
'Til you come back to me, that's what I'm gonna do
	    Living for you, my dear, is like living in a world of constant fear
	    Hear my plea  I've got to make you see that our love is dying
Although your phone you ignore, somehow I must explain
I'll have to rap on your door,  tap on your window pane
I'm gonna camp on your steps un-til I get through to you, change your view
'Til you come back to me, that's what I'm gonna do
'Til you come back to me, that's what I'm gonna do
'Til you come back to me, that's what I'm gonna do

UP ON CRIPPLE CREEK
When I get off of this mountain, you know where I want to go
Straight down the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles, Louisiana, Little Bessie, a girl I once knew
And she told me just to come on by, if there's anything that she could do
	Up on Cripple Creek she sends me. If I spring a leak, she mends me
	I don't have to speak, she defends me. A drunkard's dream, if I ever did see one
Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win, and I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor, I had him five to one
When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough, he had won
	Up on Cripple Creek.....
I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half
And she tore it up, and blew it in my face, just for a laugh
Now, there's one thing in the whole wide world I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine dips her doughnut in my tea
	Up on Cripple Creek.....
Now, me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box
She said, "I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk."
Now, that just gave my heart a fall to the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull, my Bessie can't be beat
	Up on Cripple Creek.....
There's a flood outta California, and up north it's freezing cold
And this living off the road is getting pretty old
So, I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rollin' in
But, you know, deep down, I'm kinda tempted to go and see my Bessie again
	Up on Cripple Creek she sends me. If I spring a leak, she mends me
	I don't have to speak, she defends me. A drunkard's dream, if I ever did see one
     Whoa, hoo, whoa hoo, whoa hoo, whoa hoo  (repeat and fade)

UP ON THE ROOF
When this old world starts getting me down and people are much to much for me to take
I climb right up to the top of the stairs and all my cares just drift right into space
	On the roof it's peaceful as can be and there the world below don't bother me
So, when I come home feeling tired and beat I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I get far away from the hustling crowds and all the rat race noise down in the street
On the roof that's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so, up on the roof
	At night the stars put on a show for free, and, Darling, you can share it all with me.
Right smack dab in the middle of town I found a paradise that's trouble-proof
And if this world starts getting you down, there's room enough for two up on the roof

UPTOWN GIRL
Uptown girl, she's been livin' in her uptown world
I bet she never had a backstreet guy, I bet her mama never told her why. I'm gonna try

For an uptown girl, she's been livin' in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man, that's what I am
   	And when she knows what she wants from her type,
   	And when she wakes up, and makes up her mind
   	She'll see I'm not so tough, just because I'm in love with an
Uptown girl, you know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys,
And all her presents from her uptown boys, she's got a choice

Uptown girl, you know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been, and then I'll win
   	And when she's walkin', she's looking so fine,
	And when she's talkin', she'll say that she's mine
   	She'll say I'm not so tough, just because I'm in love with an
Uptown girl, she's been living in her white bread world, as long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man, that's what I am
     Uptown girl, she's my uptown girl. You know I'm in love with an
     Uptown girl, my uptown girl. You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl

URGE FOR GOING
I woke up today and found the frost perched on the town
It hovered in a frozen sky, and gobbled summer down
   And when the sun turns traitor cold, and shiverin' trees are standin' in a naked row
    I get the urge for goin', but I never seem to go
	And I get the urge for goin', when the meadow grass is a-turnin' brown
         	Summertime is a-fallin' down, and winter's closin' in
And I had a girl in summertime, with summer-colored skin
And not another man in town my darlin's heart could win
   But when the leaves fell tremblin' down, and bully winds would rub their faces in the snow
   She got the urge for goin' and I had to let her go
 	And she got the urge for goin' when the meadow grass was a-turnin' brown
          	And summertime was fallin' down, and winter was closin' in
Now the warriors of winter give a cold triumphant shout
And all that stays is dyin' and all that lives is gettin' out
   See the geese in chevron flight, flappin' and a-racin' on before the snow
   They've got the urge for goin' and they've got the wings to go
	And they get the urge for goin' when the meadow grass is a-turnin' brown
          	Summertime is a-fallin' down, and winter's closin' in
I'll ply the fire with kindlin' and pull the blankets to my chin
And I'll lock the vagrant winter out and bolt my wanderin' in
   I'd like to call back summertime, and have her stay for just another month or so
   But she's got the urge for goin', so I guess she'll have to go
	And she gets the urge for goin' when the meadow grass is a-turnin' brown
           	And all her empire is a-fallin' down, and winter's closin' in
	And I get the urge for goin' when the meadow grass is a-turnin' brown
          	And summertime is a-fallin' down

THE VACANT CHAIR
	We shall meet, but we shall miss him, there will be one vacant chair
	We shall linger, to caress him, when we breathe our evening prayer
When a year ago we gathered, joy was in his mild blue eye
But a golden cord is severed, and our hopes in ruin lie
	Refrain
At our fireside, sad and lonely, often will the bosom swell
At remembrance of the story, how our noble Willie fell
How he strove to bear our banner, through the thickest of the fight
And uphold our country's honor in the strength of manhood's night
	Refrain
True, they tell us wreaths of glory ever more will deck his brow
But this soothes the anguish only, sweeping o'er our heartstrings now
Sleep today, oh early fallen, in thy green and narrow bed
Dirges from the pine and cypress mingle with the tears we shed
	Refrain

VACATION
	V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N in the summer sun
Put away the books, we're out of school, the weather's warm, but we'll play it cool
We're on vacation, havin' lots of fun
	V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N in the summer sun
We're gonna grab a bite at the pizza stand, write love letters in the sand
We're on vacation and the world is ours
	V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N under summer stars
     Yeah, we'll hop in a jalopy to a drive-in movie, and never look at the show
     We're gonna hug and kiss, just like this, and I can't wait to go, go, go
We're gonna mashed potato to a jukebox tune, park your car 'neath an August moon
We're on vacation till the start of the fall
	V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, we're gonna have a ball, go

	V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, gonna have a ball
     Uh-huh, we'll hop in a jalopy to a drive-in movie, and never look at the show
     We're gonna hug and kiss, just like this, and I can't wait to go, go, go
We're gonna mashed potato to a jukebox tune, park your car 'neath an August moon
We're on vacation till the start of the fall
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, we're gonna have a ball, yeah
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, (yeah) gonna have a ball

VAYA CON DIOS
Now the hacienda's dark the town is sleeping, now the time has come to part, the time for weeping
Vaya con dios, my darling, vaya con dios, my love.
Now the village mission bells are softly ringing. If you listen with your heart you'll hear them singing
Vaya con dios, my darling, vaya con dios, my love.
Wherever you may be I'll  be beside you, although you're many million dreams away
Each night I'll say a prayer, a prayer to guide you, to hasten every lonely hour of every lonely day
Now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow, but the memories we share are there to borrow
Vaya con dios, my darling, vaya con dios, my love.

VENEZUELA
I met her in Venezuela, with a basket on her head
And, if she knew others, she would not say
But I knew she would do to pass away, to pass away the time in Venezuela
	(To pass away the time in Venezuela)
I bought for her a silken sash of blue, a silken sash of blue
Because I knew that she would do
With all of the tricks that I knew she knew, to pass away the time in Venezuela
	(To pass away the time in Venezuela)
And, when at last my ship put out to sea, my ship put out to sea
I said,  "Goodbye, don't cry for me,
For you know very well there will always be sailors ashore on leave in Venezuela
	(Sailors ashore on leave in Venezuela)
Sailors ashore on leave in Venezuela

VENUS
Venus, if you will, please send a little girl for me to thrill,
A girl who wants my kisses and my arms, a girl with all the charms of you
Venus, make her fair, a lovely girl with sunlight in her hair,
And take the brightest stars up in the skies and place them uin her eyes for you.
	Venus, goddess of love that you are, surely the things I ask can't be too great a task.
Venus, if you do, I promise that I always will be true;
I'll give her all the love I have to give as long as we both shall live.
Hey, Venus, oh, Venus, make my wish come true.

VENUS IN BLUE JEANS
She's Venus in blue jeans, Mona Lisa with a ponytail
She's a walkin', talkin' work of art, she's the girl  who stole my heart

My Venus in blue jeans is the Cinderella I adore
She's my very special angel too, a fairytale come true
	They say there're seven wonders in the world, but what they say is out of date
	There're more than seven wonders in the world, I just met number eight
My Venus in blue jeans is everything I hoped she'd be
A teenage goddess from above, and she belongs to me

THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU
The very thought of you and I forget to do
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do.
	I'm living in a kind of daydream, I'm happy as a king,
	And foolish though it may seem, to me that's  everything.
The mere idea of you, the longing here for you;
You'll never know how slow the moments go 'til I'm near to you.
	I see your face in every flower, your eyes in stars above
	It's just the thought of you, the very thought of you, my love.

VIVA LAS VEGAS
Bright light city gonna set my soul, gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn, so get those stakes up higher
There's a thousand pretty women waitin' out there, and they're all livin' devil may care
And I'm just the devil with love to spare, Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas

How I wish that there were more than the twenty-four hours in the day
'Cause even if there were forty more, I wouldn't sleep a minute away
Oh, there's black jack and poker and the roulette wheel, a fortune won and lost on ev'ry deal
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel, Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas
	Viva Las Vegas with you neon flashin',  and your one armbandits crashin'
	All those hopes down the drain
	Viva Las Vegas turnin' day into nighttime, turnin' night into daytime
	If you see it once, you'll never be the same again
I'm gonna keep on the run, I'm gonna have me some fun, if it costs me my very last dime

Let me shoot a seven with ev'ry shot
Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas, Viva, Viva Las Vegas

VOLARE
	Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
	And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine ap-pears
	But you and I have our love always there to re-mind us
	There is a way we can leave all the shadows be-hind us
Volare, oh, oh, cantare, oh oh oh oh
Let's fly way up in the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
	We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of where lovers enjoy peace of mind                        	Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
	Just like birds of a feather, a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh, oh, cantare, oh oh oh oh
	Nel blu dipinto di blu, felice di stare lassu
	E volavo, volavo felice piu in alto del sole ed ancora piu su
	Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva, lontano laggiu
	Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me
Volare, oh, oh, cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings, your love has given me wings
	We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of where lovers enjoy peace of mind                      	Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
	Just like birds of a feather, a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh, oh, cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings, your love has given me wings
No wonder my happy heart sings, volare.....let's fly a-way

WAGON WHEEL
Heading down south to the land of the pines, I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road, and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours, pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
　　　　So, rock me, momma, like a wagon wheel, rock me, momma, any way you feel
	Hey, momma, rock me
	Rock me, momma, like the wind and the rain, rock me, momma, like a south-bound train
	Hey, momma rock me
I'm runnin' from the cold up in New England, I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time string band
My baby plays the guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down,
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't a-turning back to livin' that old life no more
　　　　So, rock me, momma, like a wagon wheel, rock me, momma, any way you feel
	Hey, momma, rock me
	Rock me, momma, like the wind and the rain, rock me, momma, like a south-bound train
	Hey, momma rock me
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke, I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke,
But he's a-heading west from the Cumberland gap to Johnson City, Tennessee
I gotta get a move on before the sun,
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free
　　　　So, rock me, momma, like a wagon wheel, rock me, momma, any way you feel
	Hey, momma, rock me
	Rock me, momma, like the wind and the rain, rock me, momma, like a south-bound train
	Hey, momma rock me
　　　　     (Repeat refrain and fade)

WAITIN' FOR THE ROBERT  E. LEE
Way down on the levee in old Alabamy, there's daddy and mammy, there's Efraim and Sammy
On a moonlight night you can find them all, while they are waitin' the banjos are syncopatin'
What's that they're sayin', what's that they're sayin',
Well, while they keep playin' I'm humming and swayin'
It's the good ship Robert E. Lee that's come to carry the cotton away
	Watch them shufflin' along, see them shufflin' along
	Oh take your best gal, real pal, go down to the levee, I said the levee
	Join that shufflin' throng, hear that music and song
	It's simply great, mate, waitin' on the levee, waitin' for the Robert E. Lee
The smokestacks are showin', the whistles are blowin',
The ropes they are throwin', excuse me I'm goin'
To the place where all is harmonious, even the preacher, why, he is the dancin' teacher
Have you been down there, were you around there
If you ever go there you'll always be found there
Why, doggone, here comes my baby, on the good ol' Robert E. Lee
	Watch them shufflin' along,,,,,,,

WAITIN' FOR THE TRAIN TO COME IN
Waitin' for the train to come in. Waitin' for my man to come home
I've counted every minute of each live-long day, been so melancholy since he went away
I've shed a million teardrops or more, waitin' for the one I adore
I'm waitin' in the depot by the railroad track, lookin' for the choo-choo train that brings him back
I'm waitin' for my life to begin, waitin' for the train to come in
I'm waitin' in the depot by the railroad track, lookin' for the choo-choo train that brings him back
I'm waitin' for my life to begin, waitin' for the train to come in
	Waiting... waiting... I'm waitin' for the train to come in.

WAITING AT THE END OF THE ROAD
Weary of roaming on, yearning to see the dawn. Counting the hours till I can lay down my load
Weary but I don't mind, knowing that soon I'll find peace and contentment at the end of the road

The way is long, the night is dark, but I don't mind 'cause a happy lark
Will be singing at the end of the road
I can't go wrong, I must go right, I'll find my way 'cause a guiding light
Will be shining at the end of the road
	There may be thorns in my path, but I'll wear a smile
	For in a little while, my path will be roses
The rain may fall from up above, but I won't stop 'cause the ones I love
Will be waiting at the end of the road

WAKE ME UP BEFORE YOU GO-GO
You put  the boom-boom into my heart, you send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts
Jitterbug  into my brain goes a-bang-bang-bang 'til  my feet do the same
But something's bugging you, something ain't right, my best friend told me what you did last night
Left me sleepin'  in  my  bed, I was dreaming, but I should have been with you instead.
     Chorus:
	Wake me up before you go-go, don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
	Wake me up before you go-go, I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
	Wake me up before you go-go, 'cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
	Wake me up before you go-go, take me dancing to-night.
	I wanna hit that high yeah, yeah!
You took the grey skies out of my way, you make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day
You turned a bright spark into a flame, my beats per minute never been the same
'Cause you're my lady, I'm your fool, it  makes  me crazy  when you act so cruel
Come on, baby, let's not fight, we'll go dancing, everything will be all right
     Chorus
	Wake me up before you go-go, don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
	Wake me up before you go-go, I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
	Wake me up before you go-go, 'cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
	Wake me up before you go-go, take me dancing to-night.
	I wanna hit that high yeah, yeah, yeah!
Cuddle up, baby, move in tight, we'll go dancing tomorrow night
It's cold out there, but it's warm in bed, they can dance, we'll stay home instead
   Chorus

WAKE UP LITTLE SUSIE
Wake up, Little Susie, wake up. Wake up, Little Susie, wake up
	 1st verse:        We've both been sound asleep, wake up, Little Susie and weep
		            The movie's over, it's four o'clock, and we're in trouble deep
	 2nd verse:	The movie wasn't so hot, it didn't have much of a plot
			We fell asleep, our goose is cooked, our reputation is shot
Wake up, Little Susie, Wake up, Little Susie.
Well, what're we gonna tell your Mama? What're we gonna tell your Pa?
What're we gonna tell our friends when they say, "Ooh la-la?"
Wake up, little Susie, Wake up, Little Susie.
Well, we told your Mama that we'd be in by ten, well..
Susie baby, looks like we goofed again, wake up, Little Susie,
We gotta go home

WALK LIKE A MAN
	Ooh.........walk, walk, walk, walk. Ooh........walk like a man
Oh, how you tried to cut me down to size, tellin' dirty lies to my friends
But my own father said,  "Give her up, don't bother. The world isn't comin' to an end!"
(He said) Walk like a man, talk like a man, walk like a man, my son
No woman's worth crawlin' on the earth, so, walk like a man, my son
	Ooh.........walk, walk, walk, walk. Ooh........
Bye bye baby, I don't-a mean maybe, gonna get along somehow
Soon you'll be cryin' on account of all your lyin'. Oh yeah, just look who's laughin' now
(I'm gonna) Walk like a man, fast as I can, walk like a man from you
I'll tell the world forget about it, girl, and walk like a man from you
	Ooh.........walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, etc.

WALK ON BY
If you see me walking down the street, and I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by. Make believe that you don't see the tear, just let me grieve
In private 'cause each time I see you, I break down and cry
And walk on by (don't stop) And walk on by (don't stop) And walk on by
I just can't get over losing you, and so if I seem broken and blue, walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride is all that I have left, so let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me when you said goodbye
Walk on by and walk on by and walk by (don't stop)

WALK ON BY (Country song by Leroy Van Dyke)
If I see you tomorrow on some street in town, pardon me if I don't say hello
I belong to another, it wouldn't look so good to know someone I'm not supposed to know.
	Just walk on by, wait on the corner, I love you, but we're strangers when we meet
	Just walk on by, wait on the corner, I love you, but we're strangers when we meet
In a dimly lit corner in a place outside of town, tonight we'll try to say goodbye again
But I know it's not over, I'll call tomorrow night, I can't let you go, so why pretend.
	CHORUS  ("Just walk on by....")

WALK RIGHT IN
Walk right in, sit right down, daddy, let your mind roll on.
Walk right in, sit right down, daddy, let your mind roll on.]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout a new way of walkin', do you want to lose your mind?
Walk right in, sit right down, daddy, let your mind roll on.

WALKIN' AFTER MIDNIGHT
I go out walkin' after midnight, out in the moonlight, just like we used to do
I'm always walkin' after midnight, searchin' for you
I walk for miles along the highway, well, that's just my way of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin' after midnight, searchin' for you
	I stop to see a weepin' willow, cryin' on his pillow, maybe he's cryin' for me
	And as the skies turn gloomy, night winds whisper to me, I'm as lonesome as can be
I go out walkin' after midnight, out in the starlight, just hopin' you may be
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight, searchin' for me
	I stop to see a weepin' willow, cryin' on his pillow, maybe he's cryin' for me
	And as the skies turn gloomy, night winds whisper to me, I'm as lonesome as can be
I go out walkin' after midnight, out in the starlight, just hopin' you may be
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight, searchin' for me

WALKING MY BABY BACK HOME
Gee, it's great, after stayin' out late, walkin' my baby back home,
Arm in arm over meadow and farm, walkin' my baby back home.
We go 'long harmonizin' a song, or I'm reciting a poem
Owls go by and they give me the eye, walkin' my baby back home.
     We stop for a while, she gives me a smile, and snuggles her head to my chest.
     We start in to pet, and that's when I get her powder all over my vest.
After I kind of straighten my tie, she has to borrow my comb
One kiss then I continue again, walkin' my baby back home.
     She's 'fraid of the dark, so I have to park outside of her door till it's light
     She says if I try to kiss her she'll cry, I dry her tears all thru the night.
Hand in hand to a barbecue stand, straight from her doorway we roam,
Eats and then it's a pleasure again, walkin' my baby back home.

WALKING ON SUNSHINE
I used to think maybe you love me, now baby I'm sure.
And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door.
Now everytime I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down.
 'Cause I just can't wait till you write me, you're coming around.
	 I'm walking on sunshine...Whoah! (X3)
	And don't it feel good!  HEY! And don't it feel good!
I used to think maybe you love me, now I know that it's true
And I don't wanna spend my whole life just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend, not back for a day
I said, Baby, I just  want you back, and I want you to stay
	 I'm walking on sunshine...Whoah! (X3)
	And don't it feel good!  HEY! And don't it feel good!

WALKING THE FLOOR OVER YOU
	I'm walking the floor over you, I can't sleep a wink that is true
	I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
	I'm walking the floor over you.
You left me and you went a-way, you said that you'd be back in just a day
You've broken your promise, and you left me here a-lone.
I don't know why you did, dear, but I do know that you're gone.
	I'm walking the floor over you, .......
Now, someday you may be lonesome too, walking the floor is good for you
Just keep right on walking, and it won't hurt you to cry,
Re-member that I loved you, and I will the day I die.
	I'm walking the floor over you, ........

THE WANDERER
Oh well, I'm the type of guy who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are, well, you know that I'm around
I kiss 'em and I love 'em 'cause to me they're all the same
I hug 'em and I squeeze 'em they don't even know my name
	They call me the wanderer, yeah, the wanderer, I roam around, around, around
Oh well, there's Flo on my left and there's Mary on my right
And Janie is the girl, well, that I'll be with tonight
And when she asks me, which one I love the best?
I tear open my shirt I got Rosie on my chest
	'Cause I'm a wanderer, yeah, I'm a wanderer, I roam around, around, around
	Oh well, I roam from town to town, I go through life without a care
	And I'm as happy as a clown, with my two fists of iron and I'm going nowhere
I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around
I'm never in one place, I roam from town to town
And when I find myself fallin' for some girl
Yeah, I hop right into that car of mine and drive around the world
	Yeah I'm a wanderer, yeah, I'm a wanderer, I roam around, around, around

(I WAS BORN UNDER A) WANDERIN' STAR
I was born under a wandrin' star, I was born under a wandrin' star.
Wheels are made for rollin', mules are made to pack.
I've never seen a sight that didn't look better looking back.
I was born under a wandrin' star.
	Mud can make you prisoner, and the plains can bake you dry.
	Snow can burn your eyes, but only people make you cry.
	Home is made for comin' from, for dreams of goin' to,
	Which with any luck will never come true.
I was born under a wandrin' star, I was born under a wandrin' star.
Do I know where hell is? Hell is in hello.
Heaven is in goodbye for ever, it's time for me to go.
I was born under a wandrin' star, a wandrin' wandrin' star.
	Mud can make you prisoner, and the plains can bake you dry.
	Snow can burn your eyes, but only people make you cry.
	Home is made for comin' from, for dreams of goin' to,
	Which with any luck will never come true.
I was born under a wandrin' star, I was born under a wandrin' star.
When I get to heaven, tie me to a tree,
Or I'll begin to roam, and soon you know where I will be.
I was born under a wandrin' star, a wandrin', wandrin' star.

WAS A SUNNY DAY
	Was a sunny day, not a cloud was in the sky
	Not a negative word was heard from the people passing by
	'Twas a sunny day, all the birdies in the trees
	And the radio's singing song, all the favorite melodies
He was a Navy man, stationed in Newport News,
She was a high school queen with nothing really left to lose  (X2)
	Was a sunny day, not a cloud was in the sky
	Not a negative word was heard from the people passing by
	'Twas a sunny day, all the birdies in the trees
	And the radio's singing song, all the favorite melodies
Her name was Lorelei, she was his only girl
She called him "Speedoo", but his Christian name was Mister Earl  (X2)
	Was a sunny day, not a cloud was in the sky
	Not a negative word was heard from the people passing by
	'Twas a sunny day, all the birdies in the trees
	And the radio's singing song, all the favorite melodies

WATCHING THE RIVER RUN
If you've been thinking you're all that you've got, then don't feel alone anymore
'Cause when  we're together then you've got a lot, 'cause I am the river and you are the shore
	And it goes on and on, watching the river run,
	Further and further from things that we've done, leaving them one by one
	And we have just begun, watching the river run
	Listening, learning and yearning, to run, river, run.
Winding and  swirling and dancing along past by the old willow tree
Where lovers caress as we sing them our song, rejoicing together as we greet the sea

WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
Let someone start believing in you, let him hold out his hand
Let him touch you and watch what happens
One someone who can look in your eyes, and see into your heart
Let him find you and watch what  happens
	Cold, no I won't believe your heart is cold, maybe just afraid to be broken again
Let someone with a deep love to give, give that deep love to you and what magic you'll see
Let someone give his heart, someone who cares like me,
Let someone give his heart, someone who cares like me.

THE WATER IS WIDE
The water is wide, I can't cross over, and neither I have wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two, and both shall row - my love and I
Now love is gentle, and love is kind, the sweetest flower when first it's new
But love grows old, and waxes cold, and fades away like morning dew
There is a ship, and she sails the sea, she's loaded deep as deep can be
But not so deep as the love I'm in. I know not how I sink or swim

WAVE
So close your eyes, for that's a lovely way to be
Aware of things your heart alone was meant to see
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together
You can't deny, don't try to fight the rising sea
Don't fight the moon, the stars above, and don't fight me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together
	When I saw you first, the time was half past three,
	When your eyes met mine it was eternity
By now we know the wave is on its way to be
Just catch that wave don't be afraid of loving me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together

WAY DOWN YONDER IN NEW ORLEANS
Well, way down yonder in New Orleans, in the land of the dreamy scenes
There's a Garden of Eden, ah, you know what I mean
Yeah, Creole babies with flashin' eyes softly whisper with tender sighs
     And then you stop. Oh, won't you give your lady fair a little smile
     And then you stop. You bet your life you'll linger there a little while
	Yeah, there is heaven right here on earth with those beautiful queens
	Yeah, way down yonder in New Orleans
Way down yonder in New Orleans, woo, in the land of the dreamy scenes
There's a Garden of Eden, you know what I mean
Well, Creole babies with flashin' eyes softly whisper with tender sighs
     And then you stop. Oh, won't you give your lady fair a little smile
     And then you stop. You bet your life you'll linger there a little while
	Yeah, there is heaven right here on earth with those beautiful queens
	Well, way down yonder in New Orleans
	Yeah, way down yonder in New Orleans

WAYFARIN' STRANGER
I am a poor, way-farin' stranger, traveling through this world of woe
And there's no sickness, no toil or danger, in that bright land to which I go
	I'm goin' there to see my father, I'm goin' there, no more to roam
	I'm just a-goin' over Jordan, I'm just a-goin' over home
I know dark clouds will gather 'round me, I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields lie just be-fore me, where God's re-deemed, their vigils keep
	I'm goin' there to see my mother, she said she'd meet me when I come
	I'm just a-goin' over Jordan, I'm just a-goin' over home
	I'm goin' there to see my father, I'm goin' there, no more to roam
	I'm just a-goin' over Jordan, I'm just a-goin' over home

THE WAYWARD WIND
	Oh, the wayward wind is a restless wind, a restless wind that yearns to wander
	And I was born the next of kin, the next of kin to the wayward wind
In a lonely shack by a railroad track I spent my younger days
And I guess the sound of the outward bound made me a slave to my wand'rin' ways
       	Chorus
Oh, I met a girl in a border town, I vowed we'd never part
'Tho I tried my best to settle down, she's now alone....with a broken heart.
	Chorus

THE WAY WE WERE
Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were

Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another, for the way we were.
	Can it be that it was all so simple then
	Or has time rewritten every line
	If we had the chance to do it all again, tell me, would we, could we
Memories may be beautiful, and yet
What's too painful to remember, we simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember the way we were. The way we were.

THE WAY YOU DO THE THINGS YOU DO
You got a smile so bright, you know you could've been a candle
I'm holding you so tight, you know you could've been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet,  you know you could've been a broom
The way you smell so sweet,  you know you could've been some perfume
	Well, you could've been anything that you wanted to, and I can tell....
	The way you do the things you do. The way you do the things you do.
As pretty as you are, you know you could've been a flower
If good looks were a minute, you know that you could be an hour
The way you stole my heart, you know you could've been a crook
And, baby, you're so smart. You know you could've been a school book

You made my life so rich, you know you could've been some money
And, baby, you're so sweet.  You know you could've been some honey.
	Well, you could've been anything that you wanted to, and I can tell....
	The way you do the things you do. The way you do the things you do.
	The way you do the things you do. The way you do the things you do.

THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT
Some day when I'm awfully low, when the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of  you and the way you look tonight
Oh, but you're lovely, with your smile so warm, and your cheek so soft
There is nothing for me but to love  you, just the way you look tonight
With each word your tenderness grows, tearing my fear apart,
And  that laugh that wrinkles your nose touches my foolish heart
Lovely, never, never change, keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it 'cause I love  you, just the way you  look tonight
Just the way you look tonight just the way you  look tonight

WE
Love is all about chemistry, isn't something you go off to school to learn
Isn't math or ancient history, it's the kind of thing that comes down to simple terms
	It's not about you, it's not about me, love is all about we,  yes, it's all about we
Want to take you to that great unknown, show you to a place you've never been
Down a road where only lovers go. But before we leave, I wanna repeat again
	It's not about you, and it's not about me. Love is all about we, all about we
    With a string you can tie a knot, but you gotta have somethin' to tie it to
    Otherwise all you've got is a knot, but when it ties me to you, it's a whole other thing
	'Cause love is all about we, love is all about we
Love is not about young or old, touches everybody in a special way
It's a blanket when the nights are cold. It can even keep you dry on a rainy day
And it's not about you, it's not about me, love is all about we, yes, it's all about we
    With a string you can tie a knot, but you gotta have somethin' to tie it to
    Otherwise all you've got is a knot, but when it ties me to you, it's a whole other thing
            'Cause Love is all about we, yes, it's all about we

WEAR MY RING AROUND YOUR NECK
Won't you wear my ring, up around your neck. to tell the world, I'm yours by heck.
Let them see, your love for me, and let them see by the ring around your neck.
Won't you wear my ring, up around your neck, to tell the world, I'm yours by heck.
Let them know, I love you so, and let them know by the ring around your neck.
	Well, they say that going steady is not the proper thing.
	They say that we're too young to know the meaning of the ring.
	I only know I love you and that you love me too, so darling this is what I ask of you.
Wont you wear my ring....

WE CAN WORK IT OUT
Try to see it my way. Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way, run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
	We can work it out, we can work it out
Think of what you're saying, you can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying, we can work it out and get it straight, or say goodnight
	We can work it out, we can work it out
     Life is very short, and there's no time for fussing and fighting, my friend
     I have always thought that it's a crime, so I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way. Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see your way, there's a chance that we might fall apart before too long
	We can work it out, we can work it out
     Life is very short, and there's no time for fussing and fighting, my friend
     I have always thought that it's a crime, so I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way. Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see your way, there's a chance that we might fall apart before too long
	We can work it out, we can work it out

THE WEDDING SONG
He is now to be among you at the calling of your hearts
Rest assured this troubadour is acting on his part
The union of your spirits here has caused him to remain
For whenever two or more of you are gathered in his name
There is love........There is love

Well a man shall leave his mother, and a woman leave her home
They shall travel on to where the two shall be as one
As it was in the beginning, is now until the end
Woman draws her life from man and gives it back again
And there is love......There is love
	Oh, then what's to be reason for becoming man and wife
	Is it love that brings you here, or love that brings you life
	For, if loving is the answer, then who's the giving for?
	Do you believe in something that you've never seen before?
	There is love......Oh there is love
Yes, the marriage of your spirits here has caused him to remain
For whenever two or more of you are gathered in his name
There is love......There is love

WE JUST COULDN'T SAY GOODBYE
We thought that love was over, that we were really through,
I said I didn't love you, that we'd begin anew,
And you can all believe me, we sure intended to, but we just couldn't say goodbye.
The chair and then the sofa, they broke right down and cried,
The curtain started waving for him to come inside.
I tell you confident'a'lly the tears were hard to hide, and we just couldn't say goodbye.
The clock was striking twelve o'clock, it smiled on us below,
With folded hands, it seemed to say, we'll miss you if you go.
So you came back and kissed me, and when I looked around,
The room was singing love songs and dancing up and down.
Now we're both so happy because at last we've found that we just couldn't say goodbye.
	People in love are funny, they're mighty hard to explain
	One minute they quarrel, then they're back together again
	Take my case for instance, we had a little fuss
	Now listen, ladies and gentlemen, here's what happened to us  (repeat song)

WELCOME BACK
	Welcome back, your dreams were your ticket out
	Welcome back, to that same old place that you laughed about
Well the names have all changed since you hung around
But those dreams have remained and they've turned around
Who'd have thought they'd lead ya (who'd have thought they'd lead ya)
Back here where we need ya (back here where we need ya)
Yeah, we tease him a lot 'cause we got him on the spot
	Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back, welcome back
	Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back
	Welcome back, we always could spot a friend
	Welcome back, and I smile to think how you must have been
And I know what a scene you were learnin' in
Was there something that made you come back again
And what could ever lead ya (what could ever lead ya)
Back here, where we need ya (back here, where we need ya)
Yeah, we tease him a lot 'cause we got him on the spot
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back, welcome back; welcome back, welcome back

WELCOME TO THE CLUB
Oh, do I hear you sayin' you got hurt? Did you say that she's a flimflam flirt?
Are you sayin' that some double-dealing doll went and did you dirt? Well, bub...
Welcome, welcome, welcome to the club!
Now you know the feeling when you're stung. Now you know why "torchy" songs are sung
So you stumbled down the ladder of love to the bottom rung. Well, bub...
Welcome, welcome, welcome to the club
	Hear, hear, hear, don't look so gloomy, lookee here, here, here, its happened to me
	So have no fear, love went and threw me, but we all snap back, Mack
Ten to one, you'll give up wonderin' why, why she gave you up for that new guy
But until you find the kiss hat makes you kiss all your blues goodbye, well, bub...
Welcome, welcome, welcome to the club
But until you find the kiss hat makes you kiss all your blues goodbye, well, bub...
Wel, wel, wel, wel, welcome, wel, wel, wel, wel, welcome
Wel, wel, wel, wel, welcome to the club

WE'LL MEET AGAIN
We'll meet a-gain, don't know where, don't know when,
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day.
Keep smiling through, just like you always do
'Til the blue skies drive the dark clouds far  a - way.
	So will you please say "Hello" to the folks that I know, tell them I won't be long,
	They'll be happy to know that as  you saw me go, I was singing  this song.
We'll meet a-gain, don't know where, don't know when,
But I know  we'll meet a-gain some sunny day.

A WELL RESPECTED MAN
'Cause he gets up in the morning, and he goes to work at nine
And he comes back home at five-thirty, gets the same train every time
'Cause his world is built 'round punctuality, it never fails
	And he's oh, so good, and he's oh, so fine, and he's oh, so healthy in his body and his mind
	He's a well respected man about town, doing the best things so conservatively
And his mother goes to meetings, while his father pulls the maid
And she stirs the tea with councilors, while discussing foreign trade
And she passes looks, as well as bills, at every suave young man
	'Cause he's oh, so good, and he's oh, so fine, and he's oh, so healthy in his body and his mind
	He's a well respected man about town, doing the best things so conservatively
And he likes his own backyard, and he likes his fags the best
'Cause he's better than the rest, and his own sweat smells the best
And he hopes to grab his father's loot, when Pater passes on.
	'Cause he's oh, so good, and he's oh, so fine, and he's oh, so healthy in his body and his mind
	He's a well respected man about town, doing the best things so conservatively
And he plays at stocks and shares,
And he goes to the Regatta, and he adores the girl next door, 'cause he's dying to get at her
But his mother knows the best about the matrimonial stakes
	'Cause he's oh, so good, and he's oh, so fine, and he's oh, so healthy in his body and his mind
	He's a well respected man about town, doing the best things so conservatively

WE'LL SING IN THE SUNSHINE
	We'll sing in the sunshine, we'll laugh every day
	We'll sing in the sunshine, then I'll be on my way.
I will never love you, the cost of love's too dear.
But though I'll never love you, I'll stay with you one year,
	And we can sing in the sunshine, we'll laugh every day
	We'll sing in the sunshine, then I'll be on my way.
I'll sing to you each mornin', I'll kiss you every night.
But, darlin', don't cling to me,  I'll soon be out of sight.
	But we can sing in the sunshine, we'll laugh every day.
	We'll sing in the sunshine, then I'll be on my way.
My daddy, he once told me, hey, don't you love you any man.
Just take what they may give you, and give but what you can.
	And you can sing in the sunshine, you'll laugh every day.
	You'll sing in the sunshine, then be on your way.
And when our year has ended, and I have gone a-way.
You'll often speak a-bout me, and this is what you'll say
	We sang in the sunshine, you know, we laughed every day.
	We sang in the sunshine,  then she went on her way.
	Then she went on her way, then she went on her way.

WELL, WELL, WELL
Well, well, well, who's that a-callin', well, well, well, hold my hand
Well, well, well, night is a-fallin', Spirit is a-movin' all over this land
	Lord told Noah, build him an ark, build it out of hickory bark
	Old ark a-movin', and the water start to climb,
	God said "A fire, not a flood next time!
Well, well, well, who's that a-callin', well, well, well, hold my hand
Well, well, well, night is a-fallin', Spirit is a-movin' all over this land
	God said "Fire comin' Judgment Day," he said, "All mankind gonna pass away
	Brothers and sisters, don't you know?
	You're gonna reap just what you sow!"
Well, well, well, who's that a-callin', well, well, well, hold my hand
Well, well, well, night is a-fallin', Spirit is a-movin' all over this land
	World's not waitin' for the Lord's command, buildin' a fire that'll sweep the land
	Thunder out of heaven, comin' Gabriel's call
	And the sea's gonna boil, and the sky's gonna fall
Well, well, well, who's that a-callin', well, well, well, hold my hand
Well, well, well, night is a-fallin', Spirit is a-movin' all over this land

WE NEED A LITTLE CHRISTMAS
Haul out the holly, put up the tree before my spirit falls again.
Fill up the stocking, I may be rushing things, but deck the halls again now.
	For we need a little Christmas right this very minute,
	Candles in the window, carols at the spinet.
	Yes, we need a little Christmas right this very minute.
	It hasn't snowed a single flurry, but Santa, dear, we're in a hurry;
Climb down the chimney, turn on the brightest string of lights I've ever seen.
Slice up the fruitcake, it's time we hung some tinsel on the evergreen bough.
	For I've grown a little leaner, grown a little colder, grown a little sadder, grown a little older,
	And I need a little angel, sitting on my shoulder, need a little Christmas now.

	For we need a little music, need a little laughter,
	Need a little singing, ringing through the rafter
	And we need a little snappy happy ever after, need a little Christmas now.

WE THREE (MY ECHO, MY SHADOW, AND ME)
We three, we're all alone, living in a memory, my echo, my shadow and me
We three we're not a crowd, we're not even company, my echo, my shadow and me
	What good is the moonlight, the silvery moonlight, that shines above
	I walk with my shadow, I talk with my echo but where is the one I love
We three, we'll wait for you, even till eternity. My echo, my shadow and me

WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN
We've only just begun to live, white lace and promises, a kiss for luck and we're on our way.
Before the rising sun we fly, so many roads to choose, we start out walking and learn to run.
And yes, We've just begun.
	Sharing horizons that are new to us, watching the signs along the way,
	Talking it over just the two of us, working together day to day, together, together
And when the evening comes we smile,
So much of life ahead, we'll find a place where there's room to grow, and yes, we've just begun.

WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS
We wish you a Merry Christmas, we wish you a Merry Christmas,
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
	Good tidings we bring to you and your kin
	Good tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year!
Oh bring us some figgy  pudding, oh bring us some figgy pudding
Oh bring us some figgy pudding and bring it right here.
	Good tidings we bring to you and your kin
	Good tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year!
We won't go until we get some, we won't go until we get some
We won't go until we get some, so bring it right here.
	Good tidings we bring to you and your kin
	Good tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year!

WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY MAKES
What a difference a day made, twenty four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers, where there used to be rain
My yesterday was blue dear, today I'm a part of you, dear
My lonely nights are through, dear, since you said you were mine

Oh, what a difference a day made there's a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy since that moment of bliss that thrilling kiss
	It's heaven when you find romance on your menu
	What a difference a day made, and the difference is you
	It's heaven when you find romance on your menu
	What a difference a day made, and the difference is you

WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD (Sam Cooke)
Don't know much about history, don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book, don't know much about the French I took
But I do know that I love you, and I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be.

Don't know much about geography, don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra, don't know what a slide rule is for
But I know that one and one is two, and if this one could be with you
What a wonderful world this would be
	I don't claim to be an 'A' student, but I'm tryin' to be
	For maybe by being an 'A' student, baby, I can win your love for me.
Repeat 1st verse.

WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD
I see trees of green, red roses too. I see them bloom for me and for you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
I see skies of blue, clouds of white, bright blessed day, dark sacred night
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?" They're really saying, "I love you."
I hear babies cry; I watch them grow, they'll learn much more than I'll ever know.
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world. Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING NEW YEAR'S EVE
When the bells all ring, and the horns all blow, and the couples we know are fondly kissing
Will I be with you, or will I be among the missing?
Maybe it's much too early in the game, ah, but I thought I'd ask you just the same
What are you doing New Year's,  New Year's Eve?
Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight, when it's exactly twelve o'clock that night
Welcoming in the New Year,  New Year's Eve
	Maybe I'm crazy to suppose I'd ever be the one you chose
	Out of a thousand invitations you'll  receive
	Ah, but in  case I stand one little chance, here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing  New Year's,  New Year's Eve?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
What are you doing the rest of your life? North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life: That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days, all the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days all begin and end with me
	I want to see your face in every kind of light
	In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
	And when you stand before the candles on a cake
	Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make
Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes, in the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes, it may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life, Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life, is all of my life with you

WHAT CAN I SAY AFTER I SAY I'M SORRY
	I don't know why, I made you cry, I'm sorry sweetheart and yet
	Though you shouldn't be lenient with me, I hope you'll forgive and forget
  Chorus:
What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry? What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you. If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do
I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
I know that I made you cry, and I'm so sorry dear
So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
	You made me glad, I made you sad, I made you lonesome and blue
	And who ever knew,  who'd ever think that I would be crying to you
  Chorus

WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT
You're like the warm sunshine, I think of you all the time,
I've fallen for you and that's a fact, what do you say to that.
You're always in my dreams, I think you know what they mean,
My heart knows this is real at last, what do you say to that.
	Life could never be the same without you.
	Love was never really love without you.
	Here beside you is really where it's at, what do you say to that.
I promise I'll never leave, I'll always want you with me.
Loving you won't ever be old hat, what do you say to that.
	Life could never be the same without you.
	Love was never really love without you.
	Here beside you is really where it's at, what do you say to that.
You're like the warm sunshine, I think of you all the time,
I've fallen for you and that's a fact, what do you say to that.
My heart knows this is real at last, what do you say to that.

WHATEVER LOLA WANTS
Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets,  and little man, little Lola wants you
Make up your mind to have no regrets.  Recline yourself, resign yourself, you're through
	She'll always get, what she'll aim for, and your heart and soul is what she came for
Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets. Take off your coat, don't you know you can't win
You're no exception to the rule, she's irresistible you fool .. give in

WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO MY SONG, MA
Look what they done to my song, Ma, look what they done to my song
Well. it's the only thing that I could do half right, and it's turning out all wrong, Ma
	Look what they done to my song
Look what they done to my brain,  Ma, look what they done to my brain
Well they picked it like a chicken bone, and I think I'm half insane, Ma
	Look what they done to my song
I wish that I could find a good book to live in, wish I could find a good book
Well, if I could find a real good book, I'd never have to come out and look at
What they done to my song  (everybody sing)
	La la la la la la la la la....etc
But maybe it'll all be alright, Ma, maybe it'll all be okay
Well, if the people are buying tears, I'll be rich someday, Ma
	Look what they done to my song
Ils ont changé ma chanson, Ma, ils ont changé ma chanson, Ma
C'est la seule chose que je peux faire, et maintenant ce n'est pas bon, Ma
	Ils ont changé ma chanson.
Look what they done to my song, Ma, look what they done to my song, Ma
Well, they tied it up in a plastic bag, and turned it upside down, Ma
	Look what they done to my song
Well. it's the only thing that I could do half right, and it's turning out all wrong, Ma
	Look what they done to my song

WHAT I DID FOR LOVE
Kiss today goodbye, the sweetness and the sorrow. Wish me luck, the same to you
But I can't regret what I did for love, what I did for love

Look, my eyes are dry, the gift was ours to borrow, it's as if we always knew
And I won't forget what I did for love, what I did for love
	Gone, love is never gone, as we travel on, love's what we'll remember
Kiss today goodbye, and point me toward tomorrow, we did what we had to do
Won't forget, can't regret, what I did for love, what I did for love, what I did for...
	Love, love is never gone, as we travel on, love's what we'll remember
Kiss today goodbye, and point me toward tomorrow, we did what we had to do
Won't forget, can't regret, what I did for love, what I did for love, what I did for love

WHAT KIND OF FOOL AM I
What kind of fool am I, who never fell in love
It seems that I'm the only one that I have been thinking of
	What kind of man is this? An empty shell
	A lonely cell in which an empty heart must dwell
What kind of lips are these, that lied with every kiss
That whispered empty words of love that left me alone like this
	Why can't I fall in love, like any other man,
	And maybe then I'll know what kind of fool I am
What kind of clown am I, what do I know of life?
Why can't I cast away the mask of play, and live my life
	Why can't I fall in love, till I don't give a damn
	And maybe then I'll know what kind of fool I am

WHAT'LL I DO
     Gone is the romance that was so divine; 'tis broken and cannot be mended;
     You must go your way and I must go mine, but now that our love dreams have ended...
What'll I do when you are far away, and I am blue, what'll I do?
What'll I do when I am wondering who is   kissing you, what'll I do?
	What'll I do with just a photograph to tell my troubles to?
	When I'm alone with only dreams of you that won't come true, what'll I do?

WHAT NOW MY LOVE
What now my love, now that you've left me, how can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn into ashes, and my hopes turn to bits of clay
Once I could see, once I could feel, now I am numb, I've become unreal
I walk the night, without a goal, stripped of my heart and my soul

Et maintenant que vais-je faire, de tout ce temps que sera ma vie
De tous ces gens qui m'indiffèrent, maintenant que tu es partie
Toutes ces nuits, pour quoi pour qui, et ce matin qui revient pour rien
Ce cœur qui bat, pour qui, pour quoi, qui bat trop fort, trop fort

What now my love, now that it's over, I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars, tumbling around me, and there's the sky, where that sea should be
What now my love, now that you're gone, I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care, no one would cry, if I should live if I should live or die
What now my love, now there is nothing, only my last, my last good-bye

WHATSHERNAME
Jimmy McGregor, hey, Jimmy, come here Jimmy, you son of a gun
What 'cha been doin'? How long has it been? Hell, seven years if it's been one
How's the preacher? How's Don, did he go back to school? No kidding, I thought he was gay.

Oh and yeah, while I think of it, do you remember? Not for myself, for a friend
A girl that I brought here before I got married A couple of times at the end

I wonder if she ever got over me Anyway,
I should be flattered, for yesterday At least I mattered, where did it go?

I don't know why I'll never forget whatshername?

WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT, ALFIE
What's it all about, Alfie? Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give, or are we meant to be kind?
And if only fools are kind, Alfie, then I guess it's wise to be cruel.
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie, what will you lend on an old golden rule?
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie,
I know there's something much more, something even non-believers can believe in.
I believe in love, Alfie.Without true love we just exist, Alfie.
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie.
When you walk let your heart lead the way and you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie.

WHAT'S NEW
What's new? How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit, lovely as ever, I must admit

What's new? How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then. Gee, but it's good to see you again

What's new? Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand, and you were sweet to offer your hand

I understand, adieu. Pardon my asking what's new
Of course you couldn't know, I haven't changed, I still love you so. What's new?  Nu?

WHAT'S THAT I HEAR
What's that I hear now ringing in my ears, I've heard that sound before
What's that I hear now, ringing in my ears, I hear it more and more
It's the sound of freedom calling, ringing up to the sky
It's the sound of the old ways a'fallin'
You can hear it if you try, you can hear it if you try

What's that I see now, shining in my eyes, I've seen that light before
What's that I see now, shining in my eyes, I see it more and more
It's the light of freedom calling, shining up to the sky
It's the light of the old ways a'fallin',
You can see it if you try, you can see it if you try

What's that I feel now, beating in my heart, I've felt that beat before
What's that I feel now, beating in my heart, I feel it more and more
It's therumble of freedom calling, climbing up to the sky
It's the rumble of the old ways a'fallin',
You can hear it if you try, you can see it if you try,
You....can feel it if you try......................!

WHAT'S YOUR NAME
What's your name? I have seen you before
What's your name? Can I walk you to your door?
It's so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ee

What's your name? Is it Mary or Sue?
What's your name? Do I stand a chance with you?
It's so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ee
	I stood on the corner, waiting for you to come along, so my heart could feel satisfied
	So please let me be your number one
	Under the moon, under the stars, and under the sun
What's your name? Is it Mary or Sue?
What's your name? Do I stand a chance with you?
It's so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ee
What's your name? What's your name? Shooby-doo-bop-bah-dah!

WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS NOW
What the world needs now is love, sweet love. It's the only thing that there's just too little of
What the  world needs now is love, sweet love. No, not just for some, but for everyone.
	Lord, we don't need another mountain, there are mountains and hillsides enough to climb.
	There are oceans and rivers enough to cross, enough to last till the end of time
What the world needs now is love, sweet love. It's the only thing that there's just too little of
What the  world needs now is love, sweet love. No, not just for some, but for everyone.
	Lord, we don't need another meadow, there are cornfields and wheatfields enough to grow
	There are sunbeams and moonbeams enough to shine, oh, listen, Lord, if you want to know
What the world needs now is love, sweet love. It's the only thing that there's just too little of
What the  world needs now is love, sweet love. No, not just for some,
But just for everyone. No, not just for some, oh, but just for everyone.

WHEN
When, when you smile, when you smile at me, well, well I know our love will always be
When, when you kiss, when you kiss me right, I, I don't want to ever say goodnight
	I need you, I want you near me
	I love you, yes I do,  and I hope you hear me
When, when I say, when I say, "Be mine," if, if you will, I know all will be fine
When will you be mine?

WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN
When a man loves a woman, can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world for a good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it, she can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend, if he puts her down

When a man loves a woman, spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts, and sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way it ought to be
	Well, this man loves you, woman, I gave you everything I hade
	Tryin' to hold on to your precious love, baby, please don't treat me bad
When a man loves a woman, deep down in his soul, she can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool, he's the last one to know, loving eyes can't ever see

When a man loves a woman, he can do her no wrong
He can never hug some other girl
Yes, when a man loves a woman, I know exactly how he feels
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're my world

WHEN I FALL IN LOVE
When I fall in love it will be forever, or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is, love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
When I give my heart it will be completely, or I'll never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I fall in love.... when I fall in love.... when I fall in love with you.

WHEN I GET HOME
Whoa-ah, whoa-ah, I got a whole lot of things to tell her, when I get home.
Come on, out of my way, 'cause I'm gonna see my baby today,
I got a whole lot of things I gotta say to her.
Whoa-ah, whoa-ah, I got a whole lot of things to tell her, when I get home.
Come on if you please, I've got no time for trivialities,
I got a girl who's waiting home for me tonight.
Whoa-ah, whoa-ah, I got a whole lot of things to tell her, when I get home.
	When I'm getting home tonight, I'm gonna hold her tight.
	I'm gonna love her till the cows come home,
	I'll love her more, till I walk out that door again.
Come on, let me through, I've got so many things, I've got to do,
I've got no business being here with you this way.
Whoa-ah, whoa-ah, I've got a whole lot of things to tell her when I get home.

WHEN I'M NOT NEAR THE GIRL I LOVE
Oh, my heart is beating wildly, and it's all because you're here
When I'm not near the girl I love, I love the girl I'm near
Every femme that flutters by me is a flame that must be fanned
When I can't fondle the hand I'm fond of, I fondle the hand at hand
	My heart's in a pickle, it's constantly fickle, and not too partickle I fear
　　　　When I'm not near the girl I love, I love the girl I'm near
I'm confessing a confession, and I hope I'm not verbose
When I'm not close to the kiss that I cling to, I cling to the kiss that's close
As I'm more and more a mortal, I am more and more a case
When I'm not facing the face that I fancy, I fancy the face I face
	For Sharon I'm carin',  but Susan I'm choosin', I'm faithful to whos'n is here
　　　　When I'm not near the girl I love, I love the girl I'm near
　　　　When I'm not near the girl I love, I love the girl I'm near

WHEN I'M SIXTY-FOUR
When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine, birthday greetings, bottle of wine
If I'd been out 'til a quarter to three, would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty-  four
Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight if it's not too dear.
You'll be older too,  and if you  say the word,  I could stay with you.
I could be handy mending a fuse when your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside, Sunday mornings, go for a ride
Doing the garden digging the weeds, who could ask for more
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty-four.
	We shall scrimp and save,
	Grandchildren on your knee, Vera, Chuck and Dave.
Send me a postcard drop me a line stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forever more
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty-four?

WHEN IRISH EYES ARE SMILING
	There's a tear in your eye,  and I'm wondering why,
	For it never should be there at all.
	With such pow'r in your smile, sure a stone you'd beguile,
	So there's never a teardrop should fall.
	When your sweet lilting laughter's like some fairy song,
	And your eyes twinkle bright as can be;
	You should laugh all the while and all other times smile,
	And now, smile a smile for me
When Irish  eyes are smiling, sure it's like a morn in Spring
In the lilt of Irish laughter you can hear the angels sing
When Irish hearts are happy, all the world seems bright and gay
And when Irish  eyes are smiling, sure they steal your heart a-way.

MY WILD IRISH ROSE
My wild Irish  rose, the sweetest flower that grows,
You may search everywhere, but none can compare with my wild Irish rose.
My wild Irish rose, the dearest flower that grows,
And, someday for my sake, she may let me take the bloom from my wild Irish rose.

WHEN I SING
It's easy to be blue, it's easy to be sad, easy to be brokenhearted
I don't know about you, but when I'm feelin' bad,
There's nothin' like a song to get me started

'Cause when I sing, I feel as light as Spring,
It's a funny thing, I just feel a lot better, feel a lot better
When I sing, I start to swing, it's a funny thing,
I just feel a lot better, feel a lot better, feel a lot better than when I have to talk
-------------------------------it always gets me into trouble, yeah

WHEN I TAKE MY SUGAR TO TEA
When I take my sugar to tea, all the boys are jealous of me 'cause
I never take her where the gang goes, when I take my sugar to tea.
I'm a rowdy dowdy, that's me, she's a high-hat baby, that's she. So
I never take her where the gang goes, when I take my sugar to tea
	Every Sunday afternoon, we forget about our cares
	Rubbing elbows at the wrist, with those millionaires
When I take my sugar to tea, I'm as ritzy as I can be, 'cause
I never take her where the gang goes, when I take my sugar to tea.

WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN
When I was seventeen it was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls and soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights on the village green, when I was seventeen

When I was twenty-one it was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair and it came undone, when I was twenty-one

When I was thirty-five it was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means, we'd ride in limousines their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five

But now the days are short, I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine from fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs, and it poured sweet and clear, it was a very good year

WHEN JOHNNY COMES MARCHING HOME
When Johnny comes marching home again, Hur-rah! Hurrah!
We'll give him a hearty welcome then Hur-rah! Hur-rah!
Oh, the men will cheer and the boys will shout, the ladies they will all turn out
And we'll all  feel gay when Johnny comes march-ing home. When Johnny comes march-ing home.
	Get ready for the Jubilee,  Hur-rah! Hurrah!
	We'll give the hero three times three, Hur-rah! Hur-rah!
	The laurel wreath is ready now to place upon his loyal brow
	And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home. When Johnny comes marching home.
The old church bell will peal with joy, Hur-rah! Hurrah!
To welcome home our darling boy, Hur-rah! Hur-rah!
The village lads and lassies say, with roses they will strew the way,
And we'll all    feel    gay when Johnny comes march-ing home. When Johnny comes march-ing home.
	Let love and friendship on that day, Hur-rah, Hurrah!
	Their choicest pleasures then display, Hur-rah, Hur-rah!
	And let each one perform some part, to fill with joy the warrior's heart,
	And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes march-ing home
	And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes march-ing home

WHEN SHADOWS FALL
When shadows fall and trees whisper, "Day is ending,"
My thoughts are ever wending home
When crickets call, my heart is forever yearning
Once more to be returning home
When the hills conceal the setting sun, stars begin a-peeping, one by one
Night covers all, and though fortune may forsake me
Sweet dreams will ever take me home

WHEN THE RED, RED ROBIN COMES BOB, BOB BOBBIN' ALONG
	I heard a robin this morning, I'm feelin' happy today
	Gonna pack my cares in a whistle, and blow them all away
	What if I've been unlucky, I really haven't a thing
	There's a time I always feel happy, as happy as a king.....
When the red, red robin comes bob, bob bobbin' along, along
There'll be no more sobbin' when he starts throbbin' his old, sweet song.
Wake up, wake up, you sleepy head, get up, get up, get out of bed
Cheer up, cheer up, the sun is red. Live, love, laugh and be happy.
What if I've been blue, now I'm walkin' through fields of flowrs.
Rain may glisten but still I listen for hours and hours.
I'm just a kid again, doin' what I did again, singing a song.
When the red, red, robin comes bob, bob bobbin' along.

WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN
	Oh, when the Saints go marching in, oh, when the Saints go marching in
	Oh, Lord, I want to be in that number, when the Saints go marching in.
Oh, when the sun refuse to shine, oh, when the sun refuse to shine,
Oh, Lord, I want to be in that number, when the sun refuse to shine.
	Oh, when the Saints....................
Oh when the trumpet sounds the call, oh, when the trumpet sounds the call
Oh, Lord, I want to be in that number, when the trumpet sounds the call
	Oh, when the Saints...................

WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG
It isn't by chance I happen to be a boulevardier, the toast of Paris
For, over the noise, the talk and the smoke, I'm good for a laugh, a drink, or a joke
I walk in a room, a party, or ball, "Come sit over here," somebody will call
"A drink for Monsieur (Mam'selle), a drink for us all!" But how many times I stop and recall
	Ah, the apple trees, blossoms in the breeze, that we walked among
	Lying in the hay, games we used to play, while the rounds were sung
	Only yesterday, when the world was young
Wherever I  go, they mention my name, and that, in itself, is some sort of fame
 "Come by for a drink, we're having a game," wherever I   go, I'm glad that I came
The talk is quite gay, the company fine, there's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine
And beautiful girls (handsome young men), and some of them mine,
But often my eyes see a different shine
	Ah, the apple trees, sunlit memories, where the hammock swung
	On our backs we'd lie, looking at the sky, till the stars were strung
	Only last Ju-ly, when the world was young, when the world was young

WHEN WILL I BE LOVED
I've been made blue, I've been lied to. When will I be loved?
I've been turned down, I've been pushed 'round. When will I be loved?

When I meet a new girl that I want for mine
She always breaks my heart in two, it happens every time
I've been cheated, been mistreated. When will I be loved? (x3)

WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR
When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star, as dreamers do
	Fate is kind. She brings to those who love
	The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue, fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true

WHEN YOU WORE A TULIP
When you wore a tulip, a sweet yellow tulip and I wore a big red rose.
When you caressed me, 't'was then Heaven blessed me, what a blessing no one knows
You made life cheery when you called me "dearie" 't'was down where the blue grass grows
Your lips were sweeter than julep when you wore that tulip and I wore a big red rose (X2)

WHEN YOUR HAIR HAS TURNED TO SILVER
When your hair has turned to silver I will love you just the same
I will only call you sweetheart that will always be your name
Through a garden filled with roses down the sunset trail we'll stray
When your hair has turned to silver I will love you as today
Through a garden filled with roses...

WHEN YOUR LOVER HAS GONE
What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming that comes with each new love affair?
The love that you cherish so often may perish and leave you with castles in air.
When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies? When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn there is no sunrise, when your lover has gone.
What lonely hours the evening shadows bring. What lonely  hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean  anything when your lover has gone

WHEN YOU'RE SMILING
When you're smiling, when you're smiling, the whole world smiles with you.
When you're laughing, when you're laughing, the sun comes shining through.
But when you're crying, you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing, be happy again.
Keep on smiling, 'cause when you're smiling
The whole world smiles, the whole world smiles, the whole world smiles with you!

WHEN YOU'RE SMILING
I saw a blind man, he was a kind man, helping a fellow along
One could not see, one could not walk, but they both were   humming this song
	When you're smiling, when you're smiling, the whole world smiles with you.
	When you're laughing, when you're laughing, the sun comes shining through.
	But when you're crying, you bring on the rain,
	So stop your sighing, be happy again.
	Keep on smiling, 'cause when you're smiling
	The whole world smiles with you!
I used to worry, I used to hurry each time it started to rain
Now I see light, learned wrong from right and you'll ne-ver hear me complain
       CHORUS

WHERE DID YOU GET THAT HAT
Now, how I came to get this hat, 'tis very strange and funny,
Grandfather died and left to me his property and money
And when the will it was read out, they told me straight and flat
If I would have his money, I must always wear his hat
	Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that tile
	Isn't it a nobby one and just the proper style
	I should like to have one just the same as that
	Where e're I go they shout, "Hello, where did you get that hat?"
If I go to the opera house, amid the opera season
There's someone sure to shout at me without the slightest reason
If I go to a chowder club, to have a jolly spree
There's someone in the party who is sure to shout at me
	Chorus
At twenty-one I thought I would to my sweetheart be married
For people in the neighborhood had said too long we'd tarried
So off to church we went right quick, determined to get wed
I had not long been in there when the parson to me said

WHERE DOES IT GET YOU IN THE END?
The harder I work, the faster I earn, the faster I earn, then the richer I get
The richer I get, the faster I spend-where does it get you in the end?
The harder I work, the more that I learn, the more that I learn, then the smarter I get
But maybe the strain will injure my brain-where does it get you in the end?
	But if I work harder, get    smarter, for-get a little slower, spend a little lower
  	Earn faster, learn faster, I'll be smart as Einstein and rich as Mr. Astor
So, baby, for you I'll work day and night, get terribly rich and amazingly bright
But, honey, unless you're gonna say yes-where will it get me in the end?

WHERE HAVE ALL THE FLOWERS GONE
Where have all the flowers gone,  long time passing?
Where have all the flowers gone,  long time ago?
Where have all the flowers gone? Young girls picked them every one.
When will they ever learn?  Oh, when will they ever learn?

Where have all the young girls gone- Gone to young men every one.
Where have all the young men gone- Gone for soldiers every one.
Where have all the soldiers gone- Gone to graveyards every one.
Where have all the graveyards gone- Gone to flowers every one.
   Repeat 1st verse

WHERE IS LOVE
Where is love? Does it fall from skies above?
Is it underneath the willow tree, that I've been thinking of?

Where is she/he, who I close my eye to see?
Will I ever know the sweet "hello" that's meant for only me?

Who can say where she/he may hide? Must I travel far and wide
Till I am beside the someone who I can mean something to?
Where, where is love?

WHERE IS THE LOVE
　　　　Where is the love (where is the love), where is the love (where is the love)
	Where is the love (where is the love), where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love you said you'd give to me, soon as you were free,
Will it ever be, where is the love
	You told me that you didn't love him, and you were gonna say goodbye
	But if you really didn't mean it, why did you have to lie
Where is the love you said was mine, all mine, till the end of time,
Was it just a lie, where is the love
	If you have had a sudden change of heart, I wish that you would tell me so
	Don't leave me hangin' on to promises, you've got to let me know
    Doo doo doo doo, Doo doo doo doo
    Doo doo doo doo doo doo, Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Oh, how I wish I never met you, I guess it must have been my fate
To fall in love with someone else's love, all I can do is wait
That's all I can do, yeah, yeah, yeah
	Where is the love (where is the love), Where is the love (where is the love)
	Where is the love (where is the love), Where is the love (where is the love)

WHERE IS YOUR HEART
Whenever we kiss, I worry and wonder
Your lips may be here, but where is your heart
It's always like this, I worry and wonder
You're close to me here, but where is your heart
	It's a sad thing to realize that you've a heart that never melts
	When we kiss do you close your eyes, pretending that I'm someone else
You must break the spell, this cloud that I'm under
So please won't you tell, darling, where is your heart

WHERE OR WHEN
It seems we stood and talked like this before,
We looked at each other in the same way then,
But I can't remember where or when.
The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore.
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then,
But I can't remember where or when
Some things that happened for the first time,
Seem to be happening again.
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before,
But who knows where or when.

WHERE YOU LEAD
Wanting you the way I do, I only want to be with you
And I would go to the ends of the earth, 'cause, darling, to me that's what you're worth
	Where you lead, I will follow, anywhere that you tell me to
	If you need, you need me to be with you, I will follow where you lead
If you're out on the road, feeling lonely, and so cold
All you have to do is call my name, and I'll be there on the next train
	Where you lead, I will follow, anywhere that you tell me to
	If you need, you need me to be with you, I will follow where you lead
     I always wanted a real home, with flowers on the window sill
    But, if you want to live in New York, honey, you know I will
     I never thought I could get satisfaction from just one man
    But, if anyone can keep me happy, you're the one who can
	Where you lead, I will follow, anywhere that you tell me to
	If you need, you need me to be with you, I will follow where you lead

THE WHIFFENPOOF SONG
To the tables down at Mory's, to the place where Louis dwells
To the dear old Temple Bar we love so well
Sing the Whiffenpoofs, as-sembled, with their glasses raised on high
And the magic of their singing casts its spell

Yes, the magic of their singing of the songs we love so well
"Shall I Wasting" and "Ma--vourneen" and the rest
We will serenade our Louis, while life and voice shall last
Then we'll pass, and be for-gotten with the rest
	We're poor little lambs who have lost our way; Baa!  Baa!  Baa!
	We're little black sheep who have gone astray; Baa!  Baa!  Baa!
	Gentlemen song-sters,   off on a spree, doomed from here to E-ternity
	Lord, have mercy on such as we; Baa!  Baa!  Baa!
	Lord, have mercy on such as we; Baa!  Baa!  Baa!

WHILE STROLLING THROUGH THE PARK ONE DAY
While strolling through the park one day, in the merry, merry month of May
I was taken by surprise by a pair of roguish eyes in a moment my poor heart was stole away.
A smile was all she gave to me......Of course, we were happy as can be
I immediately raised my hat, and finally she remarked
I never shall forget that lovely afternoon I met her at the fountain in the park.

WHISPERING
Whispering while you cuddle near me, whispering so no one can hear me
Each little whisper seems to cheer me,  I know it's true there's no one, dear, but you.
Whispering why you'll never leave me, whispering why you'll never grieve me
Whisper and say that you believe me, Whispering that I love you.

WHISTLE WHILE YOU WORK
Whistle while you work (whistle). Put on that grin, and start right in to whistle loud and long
Just hum a merry tune (hum). Just do your best, then take a rest, and sing yourself a song
	When there's too much to do, don't let it bother you
	Forget your trouble, try to be just like a cheerful chick-a-dee
And whistle while you work (whistle).
Come on, get smart, tune up and start to whistle while you work

THE WHISTLING GYPSY ROVER
The Gypsy Rover come over the hill, down through the valley so shady.
He whistled and he sang 'till the green-woods rang, and he won the heart of a lady.
　　　　Ah-di-do, ah-di-do da-dey, ah-di-do, ah-di dey-di,
	He whistled and he sang 'till the green-woods rang, and he won the heart of a lady.
She left her father's castle gate, she left her own fond lover,
She left her servants and her estate, to follow the Gypsy Rover.
　　　　CHORUS
Her father saddled up his fastest steed, roamed the valleys all over;
Sought his daughter at great speed, and the whistling Gypsy Rover.
　　　　CHORUS
He came at last to a mansion fine, down by the river Clady,
And there was music and there was wine for the Gypsy and his lady.
　　　　CHORUS
"He is no gypsy, my father," she said, "But lord of these lands all over,
And I will stay 'till my dying  day with my whistling Gypsy Rover."
　　　　Ah-di-do, ah-di-do da-dey, ah-di-do, ah-di dey-di,
	He whistled and he sang 'till the green-woods rang, and he won the heart of a lady.

WHITE CHRISTMAS
I'm dreaming of a White Christmas just like the ones I used to know,
Where the treetops glisten, and children listen to hear sleighbells in the snow.
I'm dreaming of a White Christmas with every Christmas card I write,
May your days be merry and bright, and may all your Christmases be white.

WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER
There'll be bluebirds over the White Cliffs of Dover, tomorrow, just you wait and see
There'll be love and laughter and peace ever after, tomorrow, when the world is free
	The shepherd will tend his sheep, the valley will bloom again
	And Jimmy will go to sleep in his own little room again
There'll be bluebirds over the White Cliffs of Dover, tomorrow, just you wait and see
There'll be love and laughter and peace ever after, tomorrow, when the world is free
	The shepherd will tend his sheep, the valley will bloom again
	And Jimmy will go to sleep in his own little room again
There'll be bluebirds over the White Cliffs of Dover, tomorrow, just you wait and see

WHITE SANDY BEACH
I saw you in my dreams, we were walking hand in hand
On a white, sandy beach of Hawaii
We were playing in the sun, we were having so much fun
On a white, sandy beach of Hawaii
	The sound of the ocean soothes my restless soul
	The sound of the ocean rocks me all night long
Those hot long summer days lying there in the sun
On a white, sandy beach of Hawaii
	The sound of the ocean soothes my restless soul
	The sound of the ocean rocks me all night long
Last night in my dreams I saw your face again
We were there in the sun
On a white, sandy beach of Hawaii

WHITE SILVER SANDS
Where the deep blue pearly waters wash upon white silver sands
There on the brink of love I kissed her, and obeyed our hearts' command

Where the deep blue pearly waters wash upon white silver sands
We watched the sun set in the evening in a far and distant land
	So, here beneath God's blue heaven there's a place I must go
	See the sun set in the evening with the only love I know
Where the deep blue pearly waters wash upon white silver sands
There on the brink of love I kissed her, and obeyed our hearts' command

Where the deep blue pearly waters wash upon while silver sands
There on the brink of love I kissed her, and obeyed our hearts' command
	We watched the sun set in the evening, see the moon, yellow and pale
  	Watch the gauchos ride the pintos out across the pampas trail
Where the deep blue pearly waters wash upon white silver sands
There on the brink of love I kissed her, and obeyed our hearts' command
And obeyed my heart's command

A WHITE SPORT COAT (AND A PINK CARNATION)
A white sport coat and a pink carnation, I'm all dressed up for the dance
A white sport coat and a pink carnation, I'm all alone in romance
	Once you told me long ago, to the prom with me you'd go
	Now you've changed your mind, it seems, someone else will hold my dreams
A white sport coat and a pink carnation, I'm in a blue, blue mood  (repeat song)

WHO CAN I TURN TO
Who can I turn to when nobody needs me?
My heart wants to know and so I must go where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me and no one beside me
I'll go on my way and, after the day, the darkness will hide me

And maybe tomorrow I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow, beg, steal, or borrow my share of laughter
With you I could learn to, with you what a new day
But who can I turn to if you turn away?

With you I could learn to, with you what a new day
But who can I turn to if you turn away?

WHO PUT THE BOMP
Who put the bomp in the bomp-ba-bomp-ba-bomp, who put the ram in the rama-lama-ding-dong
Who put the bop in the bop-shu-bop-shu-bop, who put the dip in the dip-da-dip-da-dip
Who was that man, I´d like to shake his hand, he made my baby fall in love with me
When my baby heard, bomp-ba-ba-bomp-ba-bomp-ba-bomp-bomp
Every word went right in to her heart
And when she heard them singing rama-lama-lama-lama-lama-ding-dong
She said we'd never have to part. So....CHORUS  (Who put the bomp.....)
Each time that we´re alone, boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity shoo
Sets my baby's heart all aglow.
And every time we dance to dip da-dip da-dip dip da-dip da-dip
She always says she loves me so. So....CHORUS  (Who put the bomp.....)
Darling, bomp-ba-ba-bomp-ba-bomp-ba-bomp-bomp
And my honey, rama-lama-ding-dong forever!
And when I say dip da-dip da-dip
You know I mean it from the bottom of my boogity, boogity, boogity, shu
Who was that man, I´d like to shake his hand
He made my baby fall in love with me

WHO'S SORRY NOW?
Who's sorry now? Who's sorry now? Whose heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue? Who's crying too? Just like I cried over you.
Right to the end, just like a friend, I tried to warn you somehow
You had your way, now you must pay. I'm glad that you're sorry now.

WHY
I'll never let you go, Why? Because I love you. I'll always love you so, Why? Because you love me
No broken hearts for us, cause we love each other
And with our faith and trust, there could be no other
Why? 'Cause I love you. Why? 'Cause you love me
I think you're awfully sweet, Why? Because I love you
You say I'm your special treat, Why? Because you love me
We found the perfect love, yes, a love that's yours and mine
I love you and you love me all the time
	(I'll never let you go, why, because I love you) Because I love you
	(I'll always love you so, why, because you love me) Because you love me
We found the perfect love, yes, a love that's yours and mine
I love you and you love me, I'll love you and you'll love me
We'll love each other, dear, forever

WHY CAN'T YOU BEHAVE?
Why can't you behave? Oh, why can't you behave?
After all the things you told me, and the promises that you gave
Oh, why can't you behave?

Why can't you be good, and do just as you should?
Won't you turn that new leaf over, so your baby can be your slave?
Oh, why can't you behave?

There's a farm I know near my old home town
Where we two can go, and try settling down
There, I'll care for you forever, 'cause you're all in the world I crave
But, why can't you, oh, why can't you, oh, why can't you behave?

WHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE
Oo wah, oo wah, oo wah, oo wah, oo wah, oo wah, why do fools fall in love?
Why do birds sing so gay, and lovers await the break of day, why do they fall in love?
     Why does the rain fall from up above, why do fools fall in love, why do they fall in love?
     Love is a losing game, love can be a shame; I know of a fool you see, for that fool is me.
     Tell me why-----------------y   tell me why.

     Why do fools fall in love,....fall in love,.... fall in love,....fall in love?

WHY ME?
Now, if you've seen my baby, my baby is, oh, so fine
She's long and lean, and never mean, she tastes like cherry wine
And she's my baby, now a love like mine should never be denied
I want to hug and kiss her, oh, Lord, I really miss her all the time, all the time
	Now I said, Why, why, why, why, why? (Why me?), Why, Why, Why me? (Why me?)
	Why, why, why, why, why? Why'd she have to run away from me?
	It's a mystery, why, I love her more today than I loved her yesterday
	I thought that she'd come back to me. Why me?
Now, if you've seen my baby, tell her this for me, I'm so sad and lonely, down as I can be

WICHITA LINEMAN
I am a lineman for the county and I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
	I hear you singin' in the wire, I can hear you through the whine
	And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line
I know I need a small vacation but it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain
	And I need you more than want you, and I want you for all time
	And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line
	And I need you more than want you, and I want you for all time
	And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line

WILDFIRE
She comes down from Yellow Mountain, on a dark, flat land she rides
On a pony she named Wildfire Whirlwind by her side, on a cold Nebraska night.
Oh, they say she died one winter, when there came a killing frost
And the pony she named Wildfire busted down its stall; in a blizzard she was lost.
                     She ran calling Wildfire, she ran calling Wildfire,
                     Calling Wildfire.
By the dark of the moon I planted, but there came an early snow.
S'been a hoot owl howlin' outside my window now, 'bout six nights in a row.
She's comin' for me, I know, and on Wildfire we're both gonna go.
	We'll be ridin' Wildfire, Wildfire, ridin' Wildfire
	On Wildfire we're gonna ride. We're gonna leave  sod-bustin' behind
	Get the hard times right on out of our minds,
	Ridin' Wildfire

WILD IS THE WIND
Love me, love me, say you do. Let me fly away with you.
For my love is like the wind, and wild is the wind.
Give me more than one caress, satisfy this hungriness.
Let the wind blow through your heart, for wild is the wind.
	You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins.
	You kiss me, and, with your kiss, the world begins.
	You're spring to me, all things to me. You're life itself!
Like a leaf clings to a tree, oh my darling, cling to me,
For we're creatures of the wind, and wild is the wind, the wind.
Wild is my love for you.

THE WILD ROVER
I've been a wild rover for many's a year, and I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer
But now I'm returning with gold in great store, and I never will play the Wild Rover no more
      Chorus:
	And it's no, nay, never, no, nay, never, no more
	Will I play the Wild Rover, no never, no more
I went into an alehouse that I used to frequent, and I told the landlady my money was spent
I asked her for credit, she answered me "nay, such a custom as yours I can have any day"
    Chorus
Then out of my pockets I took sovereigns bright, and the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
She said "I have whiskey and wines of the best, and the words that I said, they were only in jest"
   Chorus
I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done, and I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And if they caress me as oft times before, then I never will play the Wild Rover no more
   Chorus

WILLKOMMEN
Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome! Fremde, étranger, stranger.
Glücklich zu sehen, je suis enchanté, Happy to see you, bleibe, reste, stay.
Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome im Cabaret, au Cabaret, to Cabaret
  (repeat)

WILL YOU STILL LOVE ME TOMORROW
Tonight you're mine completely; you give your love so  sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes,  but will you love me tomorrow
Is this a lasting treasure, or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs, will you still love me tomorrow?
	Tonight with words unspoken, you said that I'm the only one
	But will my heart be broken when the night meets the morning sun?
I'd like to know that your love is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again, will you still love me tomorrow?

WIND BENEATH MY WINGS
Oh........., oh..........
It must have been cold there in my shadow, to never have sunlight on your face.
You were content to let me shine, that's your way. You always walked a step behind.

So I was the one with all the glory, while you were the one with all the strength.
A beautiful face without a name for so long. A beautiful smile to hide the pain.
	Did you ever know that you're my hero, and everything I would like to be?
	I can fly higher than an eagle, 'cause you are the wind beneath my wings.
It might have appeared to go unnoticed, but I've got it all here in my heart.
I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it. I would be nothing without you.
	Did you ever know that you're my hero? You're everything I wish I could be.
	I could fly higher than an eagle, 'cause you are the wind beneath my wings.

Did I ever tell you you're my hero? You're everything, everything I wish I could be.
Oh, and I, I can fly higher than an eagle, 'cause you are the wind beneath my wings,
You are the wind beneath my wings.
Oh, wind beneath my wings. Fly, fly, so high against the sky, so high I almost touch the sky.
Thank you, thank you, thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings.

WINDY
Who's peekin' out from under a stairway, calling  a name that's lighter than air?
Who's bendin' down to give me a rainbow? Everyone knows it's Windy.
Who's trippin' down the streets of the city, smiling at everybody she sees?
Who's reaching out to capture a moment? Everyone knows it's Windy.
	And Windy has stormy eyes that flash at the sound of lies
	And Windy has wings to fly above the clouds,
	Above the clouds, above the clouds, above the clouds
Who's trippin' down the streets of the city, smiling at everybody she sees?
Who's reaching out to capture a moment? Everyone knows it's Windy.

A WINK AND A SMILE
I remember the days of just keeping time, of hanging around in sleepy towns forever
Back roads empty for miles

Well, you can't have a dream, and cut it to fit, but, when I saw you, I knew we'd go together
Like a wink and a smile
	Leave your old jalopy by the railroad track
	We'll get a hip, double dip, tip toppy, two seat Pontiac
So, you can rev her up, don't go slow, it's only green lights, and, alright, let's go together
With a wink and a smile
	Now my heart is music, such a simple song
	Singing again, the notes never end, this is where I belong
Just the sound of your voice, the light in your eyes, you're so far away from yesterday, together
With a wink and a smile, we go together, like a wink and a smile

WINTER WONDERLAND
Sleighbells ring, are you list'nin? In the lane, snow is glist'nin,
A beautiful sight; we're happy tonight Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird. Here to stay is a new bird.
He sings a love song as we go along Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland.
	In the meadow we can build a snowman, then pretend that he is Parson Brown.
	He'll say "Are you married?" we'll say "No, man."
	But you can do the job when you're in town.
Later on, we'll conspire, as we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland.

WISHIN' AND HOPIN'
Wishin' and hopin' and thinkin' and prayin', plannin' and dreamin'
Each night of his charms, that won't get you into his arms
So if you're lookin' to find love you can share, all you gotta do is;
Hold him and kiss him and love him, and show him that you care
	Show him that you care just for him, do the things he likes to do
	Wear your hair just for him, 'cause you won't get him, thinkin' and a-prayin,'
	Wishin' and hopin'! Just wishin' and hopin' and thinkin' and prayin',
            Plannin' and dreamin' his kisses will start, that won't get you into his heart
So if you're thinking how great true love is, all you gotta do is;
Hold him and kiss him and squeeze him and love him
Yeah, just do it and after you do, you will be his
	You gotta show him that you care just for him, do the things he likes to do
	Wear your hair just for him, 'cause you won't get him, thinkin' and a-prayin,'
	Wishin' and a-hopin', just wishin' and hopin' and thinkin' and prayin,'
	Plannin' and dreamin' his kisses will start, that won't get you into his heart
So if you're thinking how great true love is, all you gotta do is;
Hold him and kiss him and squeeze him and love him
Yeah, just do it and after you do, you will be his, you will be his, you will be his

WISHING (WILL MAKE IT SO)
Wishing will make it so, just keep on wishing and cares will go
Dreamers tell us dreams come true, it's no mistake
And wishes are the dreams we dream, when we're awake
The curtain of night will part, if you are certain within your heart
So if you wish long enough, wish strong enough, you will come to know, wishing will make it so

WITCHCRAFT
Those fingers through my hair, that sly, come-hither stare,
That strips my conscience bare, it's witchcraft
And I've got no defense for it, the heat is too intense for it,
What good would common sense for it do?
It's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft,
And, although I know it's strictly taboo,
When you arouse the need in me, my heart says yes indeed in me,
Proceed with what you're leading me too.
It's such an ancient pitch, but one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you.

WITCH DOCTOR
I told the witch doctor I was in love with you.
I told the witch doctor you didn't love me, too.
And then the witch doctor, he told me what to do. He said that...
	Ooo eee, ooo ah ah, ting tang, walla walla, bing bang.
	Ooo eee, ooo ah ah, ting tang, walla walla, bing bang.
	Ooo eee, ooo ah ah, ting tang, walla walla, bing bang.
	Ooo eee, ooo ah ah, ting tang, walla walla, bing bang.
I told the witch doctor you didn't love me true.
I told the witch doctor you didn't love me nice.
And then the witch doctor, he gave me this advice. He said that ...
	Ooo eee, ooo ah ah, ting tang, walla walla, bing bang.
	Ooo eee, ooo ah ah, ting tang, walla walla, bing bang.
	Ooo eee, ooo ah ah, ting tang, walla walla, bang bang.
	Ooo eee, ooo ah ah, ting tang, walla walla, bang bang.
     Now, you've been keeping love from me, just like you were a miser.
     And I'll admit I wasn't very smart.
     So, I went out and found myself a guy that's so much wiser.
     And he taught me the way to win your heart.
My friend the witch doctor, he taught me what to say.
My friend the witch doctor, he taught me what to do.
I know that you'll be mine when I say this to you. Oh, Baby ....
	Ooo eee, ooo ah ah, ting tang, walla walla, bing bang.
	Ooo eee, ooo ah ah, ting tang, walla walla, bang bang.
	Ooo eee, ooo ah ah, ting tang, walla walla, bing bang.
	Ooo eee, ooo ah ah, ting tang, walla walla, bang bang.
     Now, you've been keeping love from me...... (repeat to the end)

WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS
What would you think if I sang out of tune, would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song, and I'll try not to sing out of key.
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends, mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away? (Does it worry you to be alone?)
How do I feel at the end of the day? (Are you sad because you're on your own?)
      Refrain (starting with "No")
(Do you need anybody?)  I need sombody to love.
(Could it be anybody?) I want somebody to love.
(Would you believe in a love at first sight?) Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time.
(What do you see when you turn out the light?) I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.
	Refrain (starting with "Oh")
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends. Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends.
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends. Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends,
With a little help from my friends.

WITH A SONG IN MY HEART
With a song in my heart, I behold your adorable face,
Just a song at the start, but it soon is a hymn to your grace
     When the music swells, I'm touching your hand, it tells that you're standing near, and
At the sound of your voice, heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice, that a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew, I would live life through, with a song in my heart for you.
Yes, I always knew, I would live life through, with a song in my heart for you.

WITHOUT A SONG
Without a song the day would never end. Without a song the road would never bend
When things go wrong a man ain't got a friend, without a song

That field of corn would never see a plow. That field of corn would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good no how, without a song
	I got my trouble and woe but, sure as I know, the Jordan will roll
	And I'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul
I'll never know what makes the rain to fall. I'll never know what makes that grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all without a song, without a song, without a song

WITHOUT HER
I spend the night in a chair, thinking she'll be there, but she never comes
And then I wake up, and wipe the sleep from my eyes
And I rise, to face another day without her

It's just no good anymore, when you walk through the door of an empty room
And then you go inside, and set a table for one,
It's no fun, when you spend a day without her
	We burst the pretty balloon, it took us to the moon, such a beautiful thing
	But it's ended now, and it sounds like a lie
	If I said I'd rather die, than live without her

Love is a beautiful thing, when it knows how to swing, and it grooves like a clock
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part
And it's breaking my heart, to have to spend another day without her

I spend the night in a chair, thinking she'll be there, but she never comes
And then I wake up, and wipe the sleep from my eyes
And I rise, to face another day without her
	Can't go on without her........there's no song without her
	It's all wrong without her......can't go on without her

WITHOUT YOU
No, I can't forget this evening, or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows, yes, it shows

No, I can't forget tomorrow, when I think of all my sorrow
Well, I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know what you should know
	I can't live, if living is without you, I can't live,  I can't give anymore
	I can't live, if living is without you, I can't give, I can't give anymore
Well, I can't forget this evening, or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows, yes, it shows
	I can't live, if living is without you, I can't live,  I can't give anymore
	I can't live, if living is without you, I can't live, I can't give anymore

WIVES AND LOVERS
Hey, little girl, comb your hair, fix your makeup, soon he will open the door
Don't think because there's a ring on your finger, you needn't try anymore
For wives should always be lovers too; run to his arms the moment he comes home to you
I'm warning you!

Day after day there are girls at the office, and men will always be men
Don't send him off with your hair still in curlers, you may not see him again
For wives should always be lovers too; run to his arms the moment he comes home to you
He's almost here!

Hey, little girl, better wear something pretty, something you'd wear to go to the city
And dim all the lights, pour the wine, start the music,  time to get ready for love
Oh, time to get ready, time to get ready, time to get ready for love

WONDERFUL COPENHAGEN
Wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen, friendly old girl of the town
'Neath her tavern light, on this merry night, let us clink and drink one down

Wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen, salty old queen of the sea,
Once I sailed away, but I'm home today,
Singing Copenhagen, wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen for me!

WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL
Sometimes we walk hand in hand by the sea, and we breathe in the cool salty air
You turn to me with a kiss in your eyes, and my heart feels a thrill beyond compare
	Then your lips cling to mine, it's wonderful, wonderful, oh, so wonderful, my love
Sometimes we stand on the top of a hill, and we gaze at the earth and the sky
I turn to you and you melt in my arms, there we are, darling, only you and I
	What a moment to share, it's wonderful, wonderful, oh, so wonderful, my love
	The world is filled with wondrous things, it's true
	But they wouldn't have much meaning without you
Some quiet evening I sit by your side, and we're lost in a world of our own
I feel the glow of your unspoken love, I'm aware of the treasure that I own
	And I say to myself, it's wonderful, wonderful, oh, so wonderful, my love
	And I say to myself, it's wonderful, wonderful, oh, so wonderful, my love

THE WONDER OF YOU
When no one else can understand me, when everything I do is wrong
You give me hope and consolation, you give me strength to carry on
And you're always there to lend a hand in everything I do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you

And when you smile, the world is brighter, you touch my hand, and I'm a king
Your kiss to me is worth a fortune, your love for me is everything
I guess I'll never know the reason why you love me as you do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you

WON'T YOU BE MY NEIGHBOR
It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood, a beautiful day for a neighbor
Would you be mine, could you be mine
It's a neighborly day in this beauty-wood, a neighborly day for a beauty,
Would you be mine, could you be mine
 	I've always wanted to have a neighbor just like you
	I've always wanted to live in a neighbor-hood with you
So, let's make the most of this beautiful day, since we're together we might as well say
Would you be mine, could you be mine, won't you be my neighbor
Won't you please, won't you please, please won't you be my neighbor (whistle)

WORDS
Smile an everlasting smile, a smile could bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone, 'cause that would bring a tear to me
	This world has lost its glory, let's start a brand new story now, my love
	Right now there'll be no other time, and I can show you how, my love
Talk in everlasting words, and dedicate them all to me
And, I will give you all my life, I'm here if you should call to me
	And, you think that I don't even mean a single word I say
	It's only words, and words are all I have to take your heart away

	And, you think that I don't even mean a single word I say
	It's only words, and words are all I have to take your heart away
	It's only words, and words are all I have to take your heart away
	It's only words, and words are all I have to take your heart away

WORKIN' AT THE CARWASH BLUES
Well, I had just got out from the county prison, doin' ninety days for non-support
Tried to find me an executive position, but no matter how smooth I talked
They wouldn't listen to the fact that I was a genius, the man say, we got all that we can use.
Now I got them steadily depressin', low down, mind messin' workin' at the car wash blues

Well, I should be sittin' in an air conditioned office in a swivel chair
Talkin' some trash to the secretaries, sayin', here, now, mama, come on over here.
Instead, I'm stuck here rubbin' these fenders with a rag, and walkin home in soggy old shoes
With them steadily depressin, low down, mind messin' workin at the car wash blues
     You know a man of my ability, he should be smokin' on a big cigar
     But till I get myself straight, I guess I'll just have to wait in my rubber suit a-rubbin these cars
Well, all I can do is to shake my head. You might not believe that it's true
For workin' at this end of Niagara Falls is an undiscovered Howard Hughes
So baby, don't expect to see me with no double martini in any high-brow society news
'Cause I got them steadily depressin', low down, mind messin' workin' at the car wash blues

So baby, don't expect to see me with no double martini in any high-brow society news
'Cause I got them steadily depressin', low down, mind messin' workin' at the car wash blues
Yeah, I got them steadily depressin', low down, mind messin' workin' at the car wash blues

WORKIN' MY WAY BACK TO YOU
	I'll keep working my way back to you, babe, with a burning love inside
	Yeah, I'm working my way back to you, babe, and the happiness that died
	I let it get away (Do-do, do-da, do) Been paying every day (Do-do, do-da, do)
When you were so in love with me, I played around like I was free
Thought I could have my cake and eat it too, but how I cried over losing you
See, I'm down and out, but I ain't about to go living my life without you
Hey, every day I made you cry, I'll pay and, girl, 'til the day I die
	CHORUS
Oh, I used to love to make you cry, it made me feel like a man inside
If I had been a man in reality, you'd be here, baby, loving me
Now my nights are long and lonely, and I ain't too proud, babe, I just miss you so
Girl, but you're too proud, and you won't give in, but when I think about all I could win
	CHORUS
 (Yooooou, you, babe) My road is kind of long (Yooooou, you, babe) I just gotta get back home
Whoa, I'm really sorry for acting that way, I'm really sorry, ooh, little girl,
I'm really sorry for telling you lies for so long, oh, please,
Forgive me, girl, come on (give me a chance) Won't you forgive me, girl, hey (let's have romance)
Ooh, forgive me, girl (let's try again), Come on, forgive me, girl,
I want you over and over, and over and over again
	CHORUS

THE WORLD IS WAITING FOR THE SUNRISE
	Down in the lazy west rides the moon, warm as a night in June
	Stars shimm'ring soft in a bed of blue, while I am calling and calling you
	Sweetly you are dreaming, as the dawn comes slowly streaming
	Waken, love, in your bower, greet our trysting hour
Dear one, the world is waiting for the sunrise, every  rose  is covered with dew
The thrush on high, his sleepy mate is calling, and my heart is calling you

A WORLD WITHOUT LOVE
Please lock me away, and don't allow the day here inside, where I hide with my loneliness
I don't care what they say, I won't stay in a world without love
Birds sing out of tune, and rainclouds hide the moon, I'm OK, here I stay with my loneliness
I don't care what they say, I won't stay in a world without love
	So I wait, and in a while, I will see my true love smile
	She may come, I know not when, when she does, I'll lose, so baby until then...
Lock me away, and don't allow the day here inside, where I hide with my loneliness
I don't care what they say, I won't stay in a world without love

WORRIED MAN BLUES
	It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
	It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
	It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
	I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long
I went across the river and I laid down to sleep    (X3)
	It takes a worried man...
When I woke up, I had shackles on my feet    (X3)
	It takes a worried man...
Twenty-one links of chain around my leg    (X3)
And on each link, an initial of my name
	It takes a worried man...
I asked the judge, what's gonna be my fine   (X3)
Twenty one years on the Rocky Mountain Line
	It takes a worried man...
If anyone asks you, "Who composed this song?"   (X3)
Tell 'em t'was I, and I sing it all day long
	It takes a worried man...

THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN
Girl, I heard you're getting married, heard you're getting married, this time you're really sure
And  this is the end, they say you really mean it
This guy's the one that makes you feel so safe, so sane and so secure
	And, baby, if he loves you more than me, maybe it's the best thing,
	Maybe it's the best thing for you, but it's the worst that could happen to me.
I'm never gettin' married, never gettin' married, you know that's not my scene
But a girl like you needs to be married,
I've known all along you couldn't live forever in between
	And, baby, if he loves you more than me, maybe it's the best thing,
	Maybe it's the best thing for you, but it's the worst that could happen to me.
     And, girl, I don't really blame you for havin' a dream of your own
     Hey, girl, I don't really blame you, a woman like you needs a house and a home.
     Baby, if he really loves you more than me, maybe it's the best thing,
     Maybe it's the best thing for you, but it's the worst that could happen........
Oh, girl, don't wanna get married, girl I'm never, never gonna marry, oh, no
Oh, it's the worst thing that could happen, oh, it's the worst that could happen

WOULDN'T IT BE LOVERLY
All I want is a room somewhere, far away from the cold night air
With one enormous chair, oh, wouldn't it be loverly?
Lots of chocolate for me to eat, lots of coal makin' lots of 'eat
Warm face, warm hands, warm feet, oh, wouldn't it be loverly?
Oh, so loverly sittin' absobloomin' lutely still, I would never budge 'til spring
Crept over me window sill.
Someone's 'ead restin' on my knee, warm and tender as he can be
Who takes good care of me oh, wouldn't it be loverly, loverly, loverly, loverly, loverly!

WRAP YOUR TROUBLES IN DREAMS
When skies are cloudy and gray, they're only gray for a day
So, wrap your troubles in dreams, and dream all your troubles away

Until that sunshine peeps through, there's only one thing to do
Just wrap your troubles in dreams, and dream all your troubles away
	Your castles may tumble, that's fate, after all, life's really funny that way
	No use to grumble, smile as they fall, weren't you king for a day?
Just remember that sunshine always follow the rain
So, wrap your troubles in dreams, and dream all your troubles away
	Your castles may tumble, that's fate, after all, life's really funny that way
	No use to grumble, smile as they fall, weren't you king for a day?
Just remember that sunshine always follow the rain
So, wrap your troubles in dreams, and dream all your troubles away

YAKETY YAK, DON'T TALK BACK
Take out the papers and the trash, or you don't get no spendin' cash
If you don't scrub that kitchen floor, you ain't gonna rock and roll no more
	Yakety yak (Don't talk back)
Just finish cleanin' up your room, let's see that dust fly with that broom
Get all that garbage out of sight, or you don't go out Friday night
	Yakety yak (Don't talk back)
You just put on your coat and hat, and walk yourself to the laundromat
And when you finish doin' that, bring in the dog and put out the cat
	Yakety yak (Don't talk back)
Don't you give me no dirty looks, your father's hip, he knows what cooks
Just tell your hoodlum friend outside you ain't got time to take a ride
	Yakety yak (Don't talk back)

YANKEE DOODLE
Yankee Doodle went to town, a-riding on a pony
Stuck a feather in his cap and called it macaroni
	 Yankee Doodle keep it up, Yankee Doodle dandy
	  Mind the music and the step and with the girls be handy.
Father'n I went down to camp along with Captain Gooding
And there we saw the men and boys as thick as hasty pudding
	Yankee Doodle keep it up, Yankee Doodle dandy
	Mind the music and the step and with the girls be handy.
There was Captain Washington upon a slapping stallion
A-giving orders to his men, there must have been a million
	Yankee Doodle keep it up, Yankee Doodle dandy
	Mind the music and the step and with the girls be handy.
Yankee Doodle went to town, a-riding on a pony
Stuck a feather in his cap and called it macaroni
	Yankee Doodle keep it up, Yankee Doodle dandy
	Mind the music and the step and with the girls be handy.

YANKEE DOODLE DANDY
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle do or die
A real-live nephew of my Uncle Sam, born on the fourth of July
I've Got a Yankee Doodle Sweetheart, she's my Yankee Doodle joy
Yankee Doodle went to London just to ride the ponies, I am that Yankee Doodle Boy

YELLOW BIRD
Yellow bird, up high in banana tree. Yellow bird, you sit all alone like me.
Did your lady friend leave the nest again? That is very sad, makes me feel so bad.
You can fly away, in the sky away. You're more lucky than me.
	I also had a pretty girl, she's not with me today.
	They're all the same those pretty girls. Take tenderness, then they fly away.
Yellow bird, up high in banana tree. Yellow bird, you sit all alone like me.
Better fly away, in the sky away, picker coming soon, pick from night to noon
Black and yellow you, like banana too, they might pick you someday.
Wish that I were a yellow bird, I'd fly away with you.
But I am not a yellow bird, so here I sit,  nothing else to do.
Yellow bird X4

YELLOW ROSE OF TEXAS
There's a Yellow Rose in Texas, that I am going to see
She's the sweetest rose in Texas this fellow ever knew
No other fellow knows her, nobody else but me
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew
She cried so when I left her, it like to broke my heart
You may talk about your Laura and sing of Rosa Lee
And if I ever find her, we never more will part
But the Yellow Rose of Texas means all the world to me

YELLOW SUBMARINE
In the town where I was born lived a man who sailed to sea,
And he told us of his life in the land of submarines.
So we sailed up to the sun 'til we found the sea of green.
And we lived beneath the waves in our yellow submarine.
	We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
	We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
And our friends are all on board, many more of them live next door
As   we   live      a  life of   ease,  every  one   of  us  has all we need
And the band begins to play
Sky of  blue and sea of green  in our yellow submarine.  (WE ALL LIVE...)

YES, SIR, THAT'S MY BABY
Yes, sir, that's my baby, no, sir, I don't mean maybe. Yes, sir, that's my baby now.
Yes, ma'am, we've decided, no, ma'am, we won't hide it. Yes, ma'am, you're invited now.
	By the way, by the way, when we reach the preacher I'll say
Yes, sir, that's my baby, no, sir, I don't mean maybe
Yes, sir, that's my baby now.

YESTERDAY
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away, now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be, there's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.
	Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say.
	I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play, now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday, I believe in yesterday.

YESTERDAY I HEARD THE RAIN
Yesterday I heard the rain whispering your name, asking where you'd gone
It fell softly from the clouds on the silent crowds, as I wandered on
Out of doorways black umbrellas came to pursue me
Faceless people as they passed were looking through me, no one knew me

Yesterday I shut my eyes, face-up to the skies, drinking in the rain
But your image still was there floating in the air, brighter than a flame
Yesterday I saw a city full of shadows without pity
And I heard the steady rain whispering your name, whispering your name

YESTERDAY ONCE MORE
When I was young I'd listen to the radio, waiting for my favorite songs
When they played I'd sing along, it made me smile
Those were such happy times and not so long ago, how I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again just like a long lost friend, all the songs I loved so well
	Every sha-la-la-la, every wo-o-wo-o, still shines
	Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're starting to sing's so fine
	When they get to the part where he's breaking her heart
	It can really make me cry, just like before, it's yesterday once more
Looking back on how it was in years gone by, and the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad, so much has changed.
It was songs of love that I would sing to then, and I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies still sound so good to me, as they melt the years away
	Every sha-la-la-la, every wo-o-wo-o, still shines
	Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're starting to sing's so fine
	All my best memories come back clearly to me
	Some can even make me cry just like before, it's yesterday once more
	Every sha-la-la-la, every wo-o-wo-o, still shines
	Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're starting to sing's so fine

YESTERDAY'S GONE
I loved you all the summer through, I thought I'd found my dream in you
For me you were the one, but that was yesterday, and yesterday's gone

We walked together, hand in hand, 'cross miles and miles of golden sand
But now it's over and done, 'cause that was yesterday, and yesterday's gone
	We had such happiness together, I can't believe it's gone forever
Wait 'til summer comes again, I hope that you'll remember when
Our love had just begun, I loved you yesterday, and yesterday's gone
	We had such happiness together, I can't believe it's gone forever
Wait 'til summer comes again, I hope that you'll remember when
Our love had just begun, I loved you yesterday, and yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

YESTERDAY, WHEN I WAS YOUNG
Seems the love I've known has always been the most destructive kind
Yes, that's why now I feel so old, before my time.

Yesterday, when I was young, the taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue.
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game,
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame.
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I'd always built to last on weak and shifting sand.
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
And only now I see how the years ran away.

Yesterday, when I was young, so many happy songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see.
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerns itself with me and nothing else at all.
--- Instrumental ---
Yesterday, the moon was blue, and every crazy day brought something new to do.
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond.
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died.
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play.

There are so many songs in me that won't be sung, I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue.
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday, when I was young...

A YIDDISHE MAME
Of things I should be thankful for, I've had a goodly share
And as I sit here in the comfort of a  cozy  chair
My fancy takes me to a humble east side tenement
Three flights up in the rear to where my childhood days were spent
It wasn't much like paradise, but 'mid the dirt and all
There sat the sweetest angel, one that I fondly call
	A Yiddishe Mame, es gibt nit beser oyf der welt.
	A Yiddishe Mame, oy vey vi biter ven zi felt,
	Vi sheyn un likhtig iz in hoyz, ven di mame'z do,
	Vi troyerik finster vert, ven Gott nemt ir oyf oylem habo.
	In vaser in fayer, volt zi ge-lofn far ir kind,
	Nit haltn ir tayer.  Dos iz gevis di greste zind.
	Oy vi gliklekh un raykh iz der mentsh vos hot,
	Aza sheyne ma-tone ge-shenkt fun Gott,
	Nor an altitshke Yiddishe Mame, oy Mame mayn.
My Yiddishe Mama, I need her more than ever now
My Yiddishe Mama, I'd love to kiss that wrinkled brow
I long to hold her hand once more   as in days gone by
And ask her to for-give me....... for things I did that made her cry
How few were her pleasures, she never cared for fashion style
Her jewels and her treasures, she found them in her babies' smiles
Oh, I know that I owe what I am today to that dear little lady, so old and gray
To that wonderful Yiddishe Mama.....Oh Mama of mine!

YIDL MITN FIDL
Iber felder, vegn, oyf a vogn hey, mit zun un vint un regn, forn klezmer tsvey.

YOU ALWAYS HURT THE ONE YOU LOVE
You always hurt the one you love, the one you shouldn't hurt at all
You always take the sweetest rose, and crush it till the petals fall
	You always break the kindest heart, with a hasty word you can't recall, so
	If I broke your heart last night, it's because I love you most of all

YOU AND ME AGAINST THE WORLD
You and me against the world, sometimes it feels like you and me against the world
When all the others turn their backs, and walk away, you can count on me to stay
	Remember when the circus came to town, and you were frightened by the clown
	Wasn't it nice to be around someone that you knew
	Someone who was big and strong and looking out for you...
And me against the world, sometimes it feels like you and me against the world
And for all the times we've cried, I always felt that God was on our side
     And, when one of us is gone, and one of us is left to carry on
     Then, remembering will have to do, our memories alone will get us through
     Think about the days of me and you, you and me against the world

     And, when one of us is gone, and one of us is left to carry on
     Then, remembering will have to do, our memories alone will get us through
     Think about the days of me and you, you and me against the world
     You and me against the world

YOU AND THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC
You and the night and the music fill me with flaming desire, setting my being completely on fire!
You and the night and the music thrill me but will we be one, after the night and the music are done?
	Until the pale light of dawning and daylight, hearts will be throbbing guitars,
	Morning may come without warning, and take away the stars.
If we must live for the moment, love till the moment is through!
After the night and the music die, will I have you?

YOU ARE MY DESTINY
Destiny.....you're my destiny!
You are my destiny. You share my reverie. You are my happiness, that's what you are
You are my sweet caress.  You share my loneliness. You are my dream come true, that's what you are.
	Heaven, and heaven alone, can take your love from me
	'Cause I'd be a fool to ever leave you, dear, and a fool I'd never be.
You are my destiny. You share my reverie. You're more than life to me, that's what you are
You are my destiny. You share my reverie. You are my happiness, that's what you are

YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine,you make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away.
	The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping, I dreamed I held you in my arms
	When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken, so I hung down my head and I cried.
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away.

YOU ARE NOT ALONE
Say goodbye to all your pain and sorrow.  Say goodbye to all those lonely nights
Say goodbye to all your blue tomorrows, now you're standing in the light

I know some-times you feel so helpless. Sometimes you feel like you can't win
Sometimes you feel so isolated. You'll never have to feel that way again
	You are not alone. You're not alone
Never thought I'd find the road to freedom. Never thought I'd see you smile a-gain
Never thought I'd have the chance to tell you that I will always be your friend
	You are not alone. You're not alone

YOU ARE THE SUNSHINE OF MY LIFE
	You are the sunshine of my life, that's why I'll always be around,
	You are the apple of my eye,  forever you'll stay in my heart
I feel like this is the beginning, though I've loved you for a million years,
And if I thought our love was ending, I'd find myself drowning in my own tears
	CHORUS
You must have known that I was lonely, because you came to my rescue,
And I know that this must be heaven, how could so much love be inside of you?
	CHORUS

YOU, BABY
From the time I fall asleep,'til the morning comes, I dream about you baby.
And I feel al-right, 'cause I know to-night I'll be with you baby.
      And who makes me feel like smiling, when the weary day is through?
	You baby, you, no one but you, baby, nobody but you. (x2)
They say candy is sweet, but it just can't compete with you baby.
You've got everything I need, and nobody can please like you do, baby.
      And who believes that my wildest dreams, and my craziest schemes will come true
A little ray of sunshine, a little bit of soul.
Add just a touch of magic, you got the greatest thing since rock 'n' roll!

YOU BEAT ME TO THE PUNCH
That day, I first saw you, whoa whoa, passing by
　　　　I wanted to know your name, but I was much too shy
But I was looking at you so hard, until you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me, and asked me my name
You beat me to the punch, that time, you beat me to the punch oh, you beat me to the punch

Whoa, after I had known you for what seems like a long, long time
I wanted, wanted to ask you, would you please, please be mine
Whenever you came around, my heart would pound, so you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours, you beat me to the punch one more time
You beat me to the punch oh, oh, oh, oh, you beat me to the punch, yeah
	Since I love you I thought you would be true, and love me tender,
	So I let my heart sur-render to you, yes I did
	But I found out be-yond a doubt one day girl/boy, you were a playgirl/playboy
	Who would go away and leave me blue
So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down, this time I'm gonna play my hunch
And walk away this very day, and beat you to the punch this time    (fade)
I'll beat you to the punch, yes I will, and let you know how it feels, oh, oh, oh

YOU BELONG TO ME
See the pyramids along the Nile, watch the sunrise on a tropic isle
Just remember, darlin' all the while...you belong to me
See the marketplace in Old Algiers, send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears...you belong to me
I'd be so alone without you, maybe you'd be lonesome too, and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane, see the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again...you belong to me.

YOU CAN CLOSE YOUR EYES
Well the sun is surely sinkin' down, but the moon is slowly risin'.
So this old world must still be spinnin' 'round, and I still love you.
	So close your eyes, you can close your eyes, it's alright.
	 I don't know no love songs, and I can't sing the blues anymore.
	But I can sing this song; and you can sing this song, when I'm gone.
It won't be long before another day. We gonna have a good time,
And no one's gonna take that time away. You can stay as long as you like.
	So close your eyes, you can close your eyes, it's alright.
	 I don't know no love songs, and I can't sing the blues anymore.
	But I can sing this song; and you can sing this song, when I'm gone.

YOU CAN GET IT IF YOU REALLY WANT
       You can get it if you really want (X3)
       But you must try, try and try, try and try, you'll succeed at last
Persecution you must bear, win or lose, you got to get your share
Got your mind set on a dream, you can get it though hard it may seem, now ...CHORUS

Rome was not built in a day, opposition will come your way
But the harder the battle you see, it's the sweeter the victory, now ...CHORUS

YOU CAN'T DO THAT
I got something to say that might cause you pain, if I catch you talking to that boy again,
I'm gonna let you down, and leave you flat, because I told you before, oh, you can't do that.
Well it's the second time I caught you talking to him,
Do I have to tell you one more time I think it's a sin.
I think I'll let you down, and leave you flat, because I told you before, oh, you can't do that.
	Everybody's gree--een, 'cause I'm the one who won your love,
	But if they'd see--een, you talking that way, they'd laugh in my face.
So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine, I can't help my feelings,  I go out of my mind,
I'm gonna let you down, and leave you flat, because I told you before, oh, you can't do that.
	Everybody's gree--een, 'cause I'm the one who won your love,
	But if they'd see--een, you talking that way, they'd laugh in my face.
So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine, I can't help my feelings,  I go out of my mind,
I'm gonna let you down, and leave you flat, because I told you before, oh, you can't do that.
Yes, I told you before, oh don't do that!

YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVE
I need love, love, love, to ease my mind, I need to find, find someone to call mine
But Mama said you can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time, no matter how long it takes
   But how many heartaches must I stand, before I find a love to let me live again?
   Right now the only thing that keeps me hangin' on, when I feel my strength, yeah, is almost gone
I remember Mama said you can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take
How long must I wait? How much more can I take?
Before loneliness will cause my heart, heart to break?
   No, I can't bear to live my life alone, I grow impatient for a love to call my own
   But when I feel that I, I simply can't go on, these precious words keeps me hangin' on,
I remember Mama said you can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time, no matter how long it takes- now wait!
No, love, love, love don't come easy,  but I keep on waiting, anticipating
For that soft voice to talk to me at night,  for some tender arms to hold me tight
I keep waiting, I keep on waiting, but it ain't easy, it ain't easy
But Mama said:  CHORUS

YOU'D BE SO NICE TO COME HOME TO
You'd be  so    nice to come home to, you'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby, you'd be all that I could desire
Under stars chilled by the winter, under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise, to come home to and love

YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE SO NICE
You didn't have to be so nice, I would have liked you anyway.
If you had just looked once or twice,  and gone upon your quiet way.
	      Today said the time was right for me to follow you.
	    I knew I'd find you in a day or two, and it's true
You came upon a quiet day, you simply seemed to take your place.
I knew that it would be that way, the minute that I saw your face.
And when we've had a few more days, I wonder if I'll get to say
You didn't have to be so nice, I would have liked you anyway.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY YOU LOVE ME
When I said I needed you, you said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you, and now you've gone a-way
Don't you see? But now you've gone, and I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you, and beg you to come home
	You don't have to say you love me, just be close at hand
	You don't have to stay forever, I will understand
	Believe me, believe me, I can't help but love you
	But believe me, I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just  a memory, life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness, there's nothing left to feel
	You don't have to say you love me, just be close at hand
	You don't have to stay forever, I will understand
	Believe me, believe me,
	You don't have to say you love me, just be close at hand
	You don't have to stay forever, I will understand
	Believe me, believe me, believe me!

YOU DON'T KNOW ME
You give your hand to me and then you say hello,
And I can hardly speak, my heart is beating so
And anyone can tell you think you know me well, but you don't know me.

No, you don't know the one who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips, and longs to hold you tight
To you I'm just a friend, that's all I've ever been, but you don't know me.
	For I never knew the art of making love, though my heart ached with love for you
	Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by, the chance that you might love me too.
You give your hand to me and then you say goodbye,
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
You'll never, never know the one who loves you so, no you don't know me

YOU DON'T MESS AROUND WITH JIM
Uptown got its hustlers, the bowery got its bums
42 Street got big Jim Walker, he's a pool-shootin' son of a gun
Yeah, he's big and dumb as a man can come, but he's stronger than a country hoss
And when the bad folks all get together at night,
You know, they all call big Jim boss, just because
	And they say you don't tug on Superman's cape, you don't spit into the wind
	You don't pull the mask off an old Lone Ranger,
            And you don't mess around with Jim. Do, do, do, da, dee dee dee dee dee
Well, outta south Alabama come a country boy, said he's lookin' for a man named Jim
I am a pool-shootin' boy, my name is Willy McCoy, but down home they call me Slim
Yeah, I'm lookin' for the King of 42nd Street, he drives an ol' drop top Cadillac
Last week he took all my money, and it may sound funny, but I come to get my money back
And everybody say, "Jack, don't ya know,"
	You don't tug on Superman's cape, you don't spit into the wind
	You don't pull the mask off an old Lone Ranger,
            And you don't mess around with Jim. Do, do, do, da, dee dee dee dee dee
Well, a hush fell over the pool room, as Jimmy come boppin' in off the street
And when the cuttin' was done, the only part that wasn't bloody was the soles of the big man's feet
Whoo! Yeah, he was in 'bout a hundred places, and he was shot in a couple more
And you better believe they sung a different kinda story when Big Jim hit the floor
	Well, they say you don't tug on Superman's cape, you don't spit into the wind
	You don't pull the mask off an old Lone Ranger,
            And you don't mess around with Slim! Do, do, do, da, dee dee dee dee dee

YOU GOT IT
Every time I look into your lovely eyes, I see a love that money just can't buy.
One look from you, I drift away. I pray that you are here to stay.
	Anything you want, you got it. Anything you need, you got it.
	Anything at all, you got it, baby!
Every time I hold you, I begin to understand, everything about you tells me I'm your man.
I live my life to be with you. No one can do the things you do.
	Anything you want, you got it. Anything you need, you got it.
	Anything at all, you got it, baby!
     Anything you want, anything you need, anything at all
I'm glad to give my love to you. I know you feel the way I do.
	Anything you want, you got it. Anything you need, you got it.
	Anything at all, you got it, baby!  (X2)
      	Anything at all, baby, you got it!

YOU GO TO MY HEAD
You go to my head, and you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne.
You go to my head, like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very  mention of you, like the kicker in a julep or two.
	The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea casts a spell over me
	Still I say to my-self: get a hold of your-self, can't you see that it never can be?
You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys you intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Tho' I'm certain that this heart of mine hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance,
You go to my head.

YOU GOTTA HAVE HEART
You gotta have heart, all you really need is heart
When the odds are sayin' you'll never win, that's when the grin should start
You gotta have hope, mustn't sit around and mope
Nothin's half as bad as it may appear, wait'll next  year, and hope
	When your luck is battin' zero, get your chin up off the floor
	Mister you can be a hero, you can open any door, there's nothin' to it but to do it
You gotta have heart, miles 'n miles n' miles of heart
Oh, it's fine to be a genius of course, but keep that old horse before the cart
First you gotta have heart!

YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES
You don't drive a big fast car. You don't look like a movie star
And on your money we won't get far. But, baby, you got what it takes, to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
	Whoa-oh, oh yeah, you got what it takes for me
Now you don't live in a beautiful place. You don't dress with the best of taste
And, nature didn't give you such a beautiful face. But baby, you got what it takes, to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
	Whoa-oh, oh yeah, you got what it takes for me
     Now when you're near me, ooh-wee, my head goes around and around
     And when you kiss me, oh yeah, my love comes tumblin' down, you send me
Now you don't live in a beautiful place. You don't dress with the best of taste
And, nature didn't give you such a beautiful face. But baby, you got what it takes, to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
	Whoa-oh, oh yeah, you got what it takes for me
But baby, you got what it takes, to satisfy, you got what it takes to set my soul on fire
	Whoa-oh, oh yeah, you got what it takes for me, oh yeah,
	You got what it takes for me, oh yeah, you got what it takes for me. Oh yeah!

YOU KEEP ME HANGIN' ON
	Set me free, why don't you, babe? Get out my life, why don't you, babe?
	'Cause you don't really love me, you just keep me hangin' on
	You don't really need me, but you keep me hangin' on
Why do you keep comin' around, playin' with my heart?
Why don't you get out of my life, and let me make a new start?
Let me get over you, the way you've gotten over me, hey
	Set me free, why don't you, babe? Let me be, why don't you, babe?
	'Cause you don't really love me, you just keep me hangin' on
	Now you don't really want me, you just keep me hangin' on
You say, although we broke up, you still wanna be just friends
But how can we still be friends, when seein' you only breaks my heart again?
     And there ain't nothing I can do about it
	Set me free, why don't you, babe? Get out my life, why don't you, babe?
	Set me free, why don't you, babe? Get out my life, why don't you, babe?
	You don't really love me, but you keep me hangin' on
	You don't really need me, but you keep me hangin' on
You claim you still care for me, but your heart and soul need to be free
But, now that you've got your freedom, you wanna still hold on to me
You don't want me for yourself, so let me find somebody else, hey
	Why don't you be a man about it, and set me free?
	Now, you don't care a thing about me, you're just using me
	Go on, get out, get out of my life, and let me sleep at night
	'Cause you don't really love me, you just keep me hangin' on
	You don't really need me, so, let me be, set me free

(YOU KNOW, I KNOW) EVERYTHING'S MADE FOR LOVE
	Though you're past your baby days, still you've got those baby ways
	You're as bashful every time when I'm with you
	Though you're fond of me you say, still you keep me far away
	Oh why can't we love, just like other sweethearts do?
What do we got lips for, what do we got arms for, why do we have stars above
Oh, you know, I know everything's made for love
What do we got eyes for what, what we sigh sighs for, why do we say dovey dove
Oh, you know, I know everything's made for love
	What is the dark for, what is the park for, why are shady lanes
	Why is a cozy corner so rosy every time it rains
What have I got you for, what do you got me for, what are we both thinking of
Oh, you know, I know everything's made for love
And why do we have preachers, why do we have teachers, why do we have weddings too
Oh, you know, I know everything's made for love

Now what is this whole band for, and what is the best man for, and why do we all say I do
Oh, you know, I know everything's made for love
	What do men slay for, what do they say for, and when Cupid calls,
	Why do we go and spend all of our dough just to see Niagara Falls
Why do we keep cryin', why do we keep sighin', why do we say dovey dove
Oh, you know, I know everything's made for love
Oh, you know, I know everything's made for love

YOU MADE ME LOVE YOU
You made me love you, I didn't wanna do it, I didn't wanna do it
You made me want you, and all the time you knew it, I guess you always knew it
You made me happy sometimes, you made me glad
But there were times when you made me feel so bad.
You made me cry for, I didn't wanna tell you, I didn't wanna tell you
I want some love that's true, yes  I do, 'deed I do, you know I do
Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie, gimmie what I cry for
You know you've got the brand of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you.

YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE DANCING
You've got a cute way of talkin', you got the better of me
Just snap your fingers, and I'm walkin', like a dog, hangin' on your lead
	I'm in a spin, you know, shakin' on a string, you know
     You make me feel like dancing (I'm gonna dance the night away)
     You make me feel like dancing (I'm gonna dance the night away)
     You make me feel like dancing.  I feel like dancin', dancin', dance the night away
     I feel like dancin', dancin', ahh-ah-ah-ah
Quarter to four in the mornin', I ain't feelin' tired, no, no, no, no, no
Just hold me tight, and leave on the light, 'cause I don't want to go home
	You put a spell on me. I'm right where you want me to be
     You make me feel like dancing (I'm gonna dance the night away)
     You make me feel like dancing (I'm gonna dance the night away)
     You make me feel like dancing.  I feel like dancin', dancin', dance the night away
     I feel like dancin', dancin', ahh-ah-ah-ah
    	And, if you'll let me stay, we'll dance our lives away.
     You make me feel like dancing (I'm gonna dance the night away)
     You make me feel like dancing (I'm gonna dance the night away)
     You make me feel like dancing.  I feel like dancin', dancin', dance the night away
     I feel like dancin', dancin', dance the night away, I wanna dance!

YOU MAY BE RIGHT
Friday night I crashed your party, Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun, wasn't hurting anyone,
And we all enjoyed the weekend, for a change
I've been stranded in the combat zone, I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive, but I made it home alive, so you said that only proves that I'm insane
	You may be right, I may be crazy, but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
	Turn out the light, don't try to save me.
	You may be wrong, for all I know, but you may be right
Remember how I found you there, alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man, I said,  "Take me as I am
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while."
Now think of all the years you tried to find someone to satisfy you. I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true, that it's all because of you, and you wouldn't want me any other way
	You may be right, I may be crazy, but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
	It's too late to fight, it's too late to save me.
	You may be wrong, for all I know, but you may be right
	You may be right, I may be crazy, but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
	Turn out the light, don't try to save me.
	You may be wrong, for all I know, but you may be right
     You may be wrong, but you may be right  (repeat)

YOU MUST HAVE BEEN A BEAUTIFUL BABY
You must have been a beautiful baby, you must have been a wonderful child
When you were only startin' to go to kindergarten, I bet you drove the little boys wild.
And when it came to winning blue ribbons, you must have shown the other kids how.
	I can see the judges' eyes as they handed you the prize
	You must have made the cutest bow.
You must've been a beautiful baby, 'cause baby won't you look at you now,

YOU NEEDED ME
 I cried a tear, you wiped it dry, I was con-fused, you cleared my mind
 I sold my soul, you bought it back for me, and held me up and gave me dignity
 Somehow, you needed me

 You gave me strength to stand alone again, to face the world out on my own again
 You put me high upon a pedestal,  so high that I could almost see eternity
 You needed me, you needed me
 	And I can't believe it's you, I can't believe it's true, I needed you, and you were there
 	And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool,
 	'Cause I finally found someone who really cares
 You held my hand when it was cold, when I was lost, you took me home
 You gave me hope when I was at the end, and turned my lies back into truth again
 You even called me friend

 You gave me strength to stand alone again, to face the world out on my own again
 You put me high upon a pedestal,  so high that I could almost see eternity
 You needed me, you needed me, you needed me, you needed me,
 You needed me, you needed me

YOU NEVER CAN TELL
It was a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell
"C'est la vie," say the old folks, "it goes to show you never can tell"

They furnished off an apartment with a 2-room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale,
But when Pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well
"C'est la vie," say the old folks, "it goes to show you never can tell"

They had a hi-fi phono, boy, did they let it blast
700 little records, all rock, rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down, the rapid tempo of the music fell
"C'est la vie," say the old folks, "it goes to show you never can tell"

They bought a souped-up jitney, was a cherry red '53
And drove it down to Orleans to celebrate their anniversary
It was there where Pierre was wedded to the lovely mademoiselle
"C'est la vie," say the old folks, "it goes to show you never can tell"

They had a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell
"C'est la vie," say the old folks, "it goes to show you never can tell"  (X3)

YOU OUGHTA BE IN PICTURES
	As I look at you, a thought goes through my mind
	What a marvelous find, you'd make up on the screen
	I'm proud that I have you right by my side,
	But I'd be satisfied to lend you to the public, to be seen
You oughta be in pictures, you're wonderful to see
You oughta be in pictures, oh what a hit you'd be
Your voice would thrill a nation, your face would be adored
You'd make a great sensation, with wealth and fame your reward
	And if you should kiss the way you kiss, when we're alone
	You'd make every girl and man a fan, worshipping at your throne
You oughta shine as brightly, as Jupiter and Mars
You oughta be in pictures, my star of stars

You oughta be in pictures, you're wonderful to see
You oughta be in pictures, oh, what a hit you would be
You're lovely as a Crawford, like Davies, you are gay
You surely should be offered a starring part-right away!
	You're sweet as a Gaynor, and you're hot as a  gal named West
	You'd even make Garbo jealous, if you took a movie test
You oughta dress like Tashman, and ride in motor cars
You oughta be ion pictures, my star...of...stars!

YOU RAISE ME UP
When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary, when troubles come and my heart burdened be
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence, until you come and sit awhile with me.
	You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains,
	You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
	I am strong, when I am on your shoulders,
	You raise me up to more than I can be.
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains,
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders,
You raise me up to more than I can be. You raise me up to more than I can be.

YOU REALLY GOT A HOLD ON ME
I don't like you, but I love you, seems that I'm always thinking of you.
Though, oh, oh, you treat me badly, I love you madly,
You really got a hold on me....(you really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me....(you really got a hold on me)..baby!

I don't want you, but I need you, don't want to kiss you, but I need to.
Though, oh, oh, you do me wrong now, my love is strong now,
You really got a hold on me....(you really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me....(you really got a hold on me)..baby!
	I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me.
I want to leave you, don't want to stay here, don't want to spend another day here.
Though, oh, oh, I want to split now, I just can't quit now,
You really got a hold on me....(you really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me....(you really got a hold on me)..baby!
	I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me (please) hold me (squeeze) hold me, hold me.
You really got a hold on me..(you really got a hold on me)
I said, you really got a hold on me..(I said, you really got a hold on me)
You know you really got a hold on me.. (you know you really got a hold on me)    (Fade)

YOU SEND ME
Darling, you send me, I know you  send me, darling, you send me,
Honest you do, honest you do, honest you do, oh...........................
You thrill me, I know you thrill me, darling, you thrill me, honest you do
	At first I thought it was infatuation, but, ooo, it's lasted so long
	Now I find myself wanting...to marry you, and take you home, oh...........
You send me, I know you send me, I know you send me, honest you do, honest you do, honest you do.

YOU STEPPED OUT OF A DREAM
You stepped out of a dream, you are too wonderful to be what you seem
Could there be eyes like yours? Could there be lips like yours?
Could there be smiles like yours, honest and truly?

You stepped out of a cloud, I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, alone and apart, out of a dream, safe in my heart

YOU TALK TOO MUCH
You talk too much, you worry me to death
You talk too much, you even worry my pet
You just talk, you talk too much

You talk about people that you don't know
You talk about people wherever you go
You just talk, you talk too much

You talk about people that you've never seen
You talk about people, you can make me scream
You just talk, you talk too much

YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME
I'm a sentimental sap, that's all. What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill 'cause you took advantage of me!
I'm just like an apple on a bough and you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose 'cause you took advantage of me!
	I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know my elbow from my ear
	I suffer something awful each time you go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned, just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours, 'cause you took advantage of me.

YOU WERE ON MY MIND
When I woke up this morning, you were on my mind, and you were on my mind
I got troubles, whoa, oh, I got worries, whoa, oh, I got wounds to bind
	So I went to the corner, just to ease my pain, just to ease my pain
	I got troubles, whoa, oh, I got worries, whoa, oh, I came home again
But I woke up this morning, you were on my mind, and you were on my mind
Yeah, I got troubles, whoa, oh, I got worries, whoa, oh,  I got wounds to bind
	And, I got a feeling down in my shoes, said a-way down in my shoes
	And, I got to ramble, whoa, oh, I got to move on, whoa, oh, I got to walk away my blues
When I woke up this morning, and you were on my mind, and you were on my mind
Hey, I got troubles, whoa, oh, I got worries, whoa, oh,  I got wounds to bind

YOU WON'T SEE ME
When I call you up your line's engaged. I have heard enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind if.. You won't see me. You won't see me, you won't see me
I don't know why you should want to hide, but I can't get through, my hands are tied
I don't want to stay, I don't have much to say
But I get turned away if you won't see me,

YOU, YOU, YOU
You, You, You, I'm in love with you, you, you
I could be so true, true, true to someone like you, you, you
Do, do, do what you oughta do, do, do
Take me in you arms, please do; let me cling to you, you, you
	We were meant for each other sure as heavens above
	We were meant for each other, to have, to hold and to love
You, you, you there's no one like you, you, you
You could make my dreams come true, if you say you love me too

YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
Darling, I'm so blue without you. I think about you the live-long day
When you ask me if I'm lonely, then I have only this to say
	You'll never know just how much I miss you
	You'll never know just how much I care
	And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you
	You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
	A million or more times?
You went away and my heart went with you, I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you, I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now

YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE
When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high, and don't be a-fraid of the dark;
At the end of the storm is a golden sky, and the sweet silver song of a lark.
	Walk on through the wind, walk on through the rain,
	Though your dreams be tossed and blown,
	Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
	And you'll never walk alone, you'll never walk alone.

	Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
	And you'll never walk alone, you'll never walk alone.

YOUNG AT HEART
Fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you if you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind, if you're young at heart
	You can go to extremes with impossible schemes,
	You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams,
	And life gets more exciting with each passing day
	And love is either in your heart or on the way.
Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth to be young at heart
For as rich as you are, it's much better by far to be young at heart
And if you should survive to a hundred and five, look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start, if you are among the very young at heart.

YOUNGER THAN SPRINGTIME
	    I touch your hands, and my arms grow strong,
	    Like a pair of birds that burst with song
	    My eyes look down at your lovely face,
	    And I hold the world in my embrace
Younger than springtime are you, softer than starlight are you
Warmer than winds of June are the gentle lips you gave me

Gayer than laughter are you, sweeter than music are you
Angel and lover, heaven and earth are you to me
　　　　And when your youth and joy invade my arms, and fill my heart, as now they do
Then younger than springtime am I, gayer than laughter am I
Angel and lover, heaven and earth am I with you

YOUNG LOVE
They say for every boy and girl there's just one love in this old world,
And I know I've found mine
The heavenly touch of your embrace tells me no one can take your place
Ever in my heart
	Young love, first love, filled with sweet devotion
	Young love, our love, we share with deep emotion
Just one kiss from your sweet lips will tell me that your love is real,
And I can feel that it's true
We will vow to one another there will never be another
Love for you or for me
	Young love, first love, filled with sweet devotion
	Young love, our love, we share with deep emotion

YOUR CHEATIN' HEART
Your cheatin' heart will make you weep
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you.
When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you.

YOU'RE DIVING ME CRAZY
You! You're driving me crazy, what did I do, what did I do?
My tears for you make everything hazy, clouding the skies of blue.
How true were the friends who were near me, to cheer me, believe me they knew
But you were the kind who would hurt me, desert me, when I needed you.
Yes, you, you're driving me crazy, what did I do to you?

YOU'RE GETTING TO BE A HABIT WITH ME
Every kiss, every hug, seems to act just like a drug
You're getting to be a habit with me

Let me stay in your arms, I'm addicted to your charms
You're getting to be a habit with me
	I used to think your love was something that I could take, or leave alone
	But now I couldn't do without my supply, I need you for my own
No, I can't break away, I must have you every day
As regularly as coffee or tea
You've got me in your clutches, and I can't break free,
You're getting to be a habit with me

YOU'RE GONNA LOSE THAT GIRL
	You're gonna lose that girl, (yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
	You're gonna lose that girl, (yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
If you take her out tonight, she's gonna change her mind (she's gonna change her mind)
And I will take her out tonight, and I will treat her kind (I'm gonna treat her kind)
	You're gonna lose that girl, (yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
	You're gonna lose that girl, (yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
If you don't treat her right, my friend, you're gonna find her gone (You're gonna find her gone)
'Cause I will treat her right and then you'll be the lonely one (You're not the only one)
	You're gonna lose (yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
	You're gonna lose (yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
	You're gonna lose (yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
       I'll make a point of taking her away from you (watch what you do)
       The way you treat her, what else can I do?

YOU'RE A GRAND OLD FLAG
You're a grand old flag, you're a high flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave
You're the emblem of the land I love, the home of the free and the brave
Every heart beats true for the red, white, and blue, where there's never a boast or brag
Should auld acquaintance be forgot, keep your eye on the grand old flag

YOU'RE JUST IN LOVE
1. I  hear singing and there's no one there,  I smell blossoms and the trees are bare
All day long I seem  to walk on air, I wonder why? I wonder why?
I keep tossing in my sleep at night, and  what's more I've lost my appetite
Stars that used to twinkle in the skies are twinkling in my eyes,  I wonder why

2.You don't need analyzing, it is not so surprising, that you feel very strange but nice
Your heart goes pitter patter, I know just what's the matter, because I've been there once or twice
Put your head on my shoulder, you need someone who's older, a rubdown with a velvet glove
There is nothing you can  take to relieve that pleasant ache. You're not sick, you're just in love.
   1.Stars that used to twinkle in the skies are twinkling in my eyes,  I wonder why
   2.There is nothing you can  take to relieve that pleasant ache. You're not sick, you're just in love.

YOU'RE MY HOME
When you look into my eyes, and you see the crazy gypsy in my soul
It always comes as a surprise, when I feel my withered roots begin to grow
Well, I never had a place that I could call my very own
But that's alright, my love, 'cause you're my home

When you touch my weary head, and you tell me everything will be alright
You say, "Use my body as your bed, and my love will keep you warm throughout the night."
Well, I'll never be a stranger, and I'll never be alone,
Wherever we're together, you're my home
	Home can be the Pennsylvania Turnpike, Indiana's early morning dew
	High up in the hills of California, home is just another word for you

	Well, I never had a place that I could call my very own
	But that's alright, my love, 'cause you're my home
If I travel all my life, and I never get to stop and settle down
Long as I have you by my side, there's a roof above and good walls all around
You're my castle, you're my cabin, and my instant pleasure dome
I need you in my house, 'cause you're my home. You're my home

YOU'RE NOBODY TILL SOMEBODY LOVES YOU
You're nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares.
You may be king, you may possess the world and its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growing old (you gotta remember that)
The world still is the same, you'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love.

YOU'RE NO GOOD
Feelin' better, now that we're through, feelin' better, 'cause I'm over you
I learned my lesson, it left a scar. Now I see how you really are
	You're no good, you're no good, you're no good, baby, you're no good. I'm gonna say it again
	You're no good, you're no good, you're no good, baby, you're no good
I broke a heart that's gentle and true, well, I broke a heart over someone like you
I'll beg her/his forgiveness on bended knee, I wouldn't blame her/him if she/he said to me
	You're no good, you're no good, you're no good, baby, you're no good. I'm gonna say it again
	You're no good, you're no good, you're no good, baby, you're no good.
I'm turning you down, baby, and I'm going my way, for-get about you, baby, 'cause I'm leaving to stay
	You're no good, you're no good, you're no good, baby, you're no good. I'm gonna say it a-gain
	You're no good, you're no good, you're no good, baby, you're no good.
	You're no good, you're no good, you're no good, baby, you're no good.

YOU'RE ONLY LONELY
 When the world is ready to fall on your little shoulders
And when you're feeling lonely and small, you need somebody there to hold you
	So, you can call out my name, when you're only lonely
	Now don't you ever be ashamed, when you're only lonely
When you need somebody around on the nights that try you.....remember
 I was there when you were a queen, and I'll be the last one there beside you
	 So, you can call out my name, when you're only lonely
       	Now don't you ever be ashamed, when you're only lonely
  	You're only lonely, you're only lonely, you're only lonely, you're only lonely
When the world is ready to fall on your little shoulders
And when you're feeling lonely and small, you need somebody there to hold you
       So, don't you ever be ashamed, when you're only lonely
       Ah, you can call out my name, when you're only lonely
       You're only lonely, when you're only lonely, you're only lonely,
Oh, it's no crime,  darling, we got lots of time, you're only lonely, you're only lonely
Ah, there's nothing wrong with you, darlin', I get lonely too
You're only lonely, you're only lonely, so if you need me, all you gotta do is call me

YOU'RE SIXTEEN
You come on like a dream, peaches and cream, lips like strawberry wine.
You're sixteen, you're beautiful and you're mine.
You're all ribbons and curls, ooh, what a girl, eyes that sparkle and shine.
You're sixteen, you're beautiful and you're mine.
	You're my baby, you're my pet, we fell in love on the night we met.
	You touched my hand, my heart went pop, and, ooh, when we kissed, I could not stop.
You walked out of my dreams, and into my arms, now you're my angel divine.
You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine, mine all mine,
You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine.

YOU'RE STILL THE ONE
We've been together since way back when. Sometimes I never want to see you again
But I want you to know, after all these years, you're still the one I want whisperin' in my ear
	You're still the one I want to talk to in bed, still the one that turns my head
	We're still having fun, and you're still the one
I looked at your face every day, but I never saw it 'til I went away
When winter came, I just wanted to go, deep in the desert, I longed for the snow
	You're still the one that makes me laugh, still the one that's my better half
	We're still having fun, and you're still the one
	You're still the one that makes me strong, still the one I want to take along
	We're still having fun and you're still the one
Changing, our love is going gold, even though we grow old, it grows new
	You're still the one that I love to touch, still the one and I can't  get enough
	We're still having fun, and you're still the one
	You're still the one who can scratch my itch, still the one and I wouldn't switch
	We're still having fun, and you're still the one
You are still the one that makes me shout, still the one that I dream about
	You're still the one that I love to touch, still the one and I can't  get enough
	We're still having fun, and you're still the one
	You're still the one..........still the one ........
	We're still having fun, and you're still the one

YOU'RE STILL THE ONE  (Shania Twain)
Looks like we made it, look how far we've come, my baby
We mighta took the long way, we knew we'd get there someday
     They said, "I bet they'll never make it," but just look at us holdin' on
     We're still together, still goin' strong
	(You're still the one) You're still the one I run to, the one that I belong to
	You're still the one I want for life
	(You're still the one) You're still the one that I love, the only one I dream of
	You're still the one I kiss good night
Ain't nothin' better, we beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen, look at what we would be missin'
     They said, "I bet they'll never make it," but just look at us holdin' on
     We're still together, still goin' strong
	(You're still the one) You're still the one I run to, the one that I belong to
	You're still the one I want for life
	(You're still the one) You're still the one that I love, the only one I dream of
	You're still the one I kiss good night.  You're still the one

	(You're still the one) You're still the one I run to, the one that I belong to
	You're still the one I want for life
	(You're still the one) You're still the one that I love, the only one I dream of
	You're still the one I kiss good night
Looks like we made it, look how far we've come, my baby

YOU'RE THE CREAM IN MY COFFEE
I'm not a poet, how well  I know it, I've never been a raver
But when  I speak of you, I rave a bit, it's true
I'm wild about you, I'm lost without you, you give my life its flavor
What sugar does for tea, that's what you do for me

You're the cream in my coffee, you're the salt in my stew
You will always be my necessity, I'd be lost without you
You're the starch in my collar, you're the lace in my shoe
You will always be my necessity, I'd be lost without you
	Most men tell love tales, and each phrase dovetails
	You've heard each known way, this way is my own way
You're the sail of my loveboat, you're the captain and crew
You will always be my necessity, I'd be lost without you

YOU'RE THE REASON I'M LIVING
You're the reason I'm living, you're the breath that I take
You're the stars in my heaven, you're the sun when I wake
You're the reason I'm living, oh, you carry me through
All of life's little burdens, I'd be lost without you
	A long long time ago, when I was down, wo-o-o you picked me up
	And showed me true love still could be found
You're the reason I do things, you're the things that I do
You're the reason I'm living, I'd be lost without you....Come and tell me again
You're the reason I'm living, oh, you carry me through
All of life's little burdens, I'd be lost without you

YOUR HEART WILL LEAD YOU HOME
Sunny days and starry nights and lazy afternoons
You're countin' castles in the clouds and hummin' little tunes
But somehow, right before your eyes the summer fades away
Everything is different and everything has changed
	If you feel lost and on your own and far from home,
	You're never a-lone, you know
	Just think of your friends, the ones who care,
	They all will be waiting there with love to share
	And your heart will lead you home.
Funny how a photograph can take you back in time
To places and em-braces that you thought you'd left behind
They're trying to re-mind you that you're not the only one
That no one is an island when all is said and done.   (REFRAIN)
There'll come a day when you're losing your way
And you won't know where you belong
       They say that "Home is where the heart is"
So follow your heart and know that you can't go wrong   (REFRAIN)

YOUR SMILING FACE
Whenever I see your smiling face, I have to smile myself, because I love you.
And when you give me that pretty little pout, it turns me inside out.
There's somethin' about you, baby, I don't know.
	Isn't it amazing a man like me can feel this way?
	Tell me how much longer, it can grow stronger every day,  oh, how much longer?
I thought I was in love a couple of times before with the girl next door,
But that was long before I met ya.  Now I'm sure that I won't forget ya.
And I thank my lucky stars that you are who you are and not just
Another lovely lady, sent down to break my heart.
	Isn't it amazing a man like me can feel this way?
	Tell me how much longer, it can grow stronger every day.  How much longer?
    No one can tell me that I'm doin' wrong today, whenever I see you smilin' at me
    No one can tell me that I'm doin' wrong today, whenever I see your smilin' face my way
    No one can tell me that I'm doin' wrong today, whenever I see you smilin' at me
    No one can tell me that I'm doin' wrong today, whenever I see your smilin' face

YOUR SONG
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside. I'm not one of those who can, easily hide
I don't have much money, but,  boy if I did, I'd buy a big house where,  we both could live
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no, or a man who make potions in a  traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do. My gift is my song, and this one's for you
	And you can tell everybody, this is your song.
	It may be quite simple but, now that it's done
	I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
	How wonderful life is, while you're in the world
I sat on the roof,  and kicked off the moss, well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote down this song
It's for people like you, that keep it turned on
So excuse me for-getting,   but these things I do.
You see I've for-gotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean, yours are the sweetest eyes  I've ever seen
	And you can tell everybody.....................

YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND
When you're down and troubled and you need some lovin' care
And nothin', oh nothin' is goin' right
Close your eyes and think of me and soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
     You just call out my name and you know, wherever I am I'll come runnin' to see you again
     Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall, all you've got to do is call
     And I'll be there yeh, yeh, yeh, you've got a friend
If the sky above you grows dark and full of clouds, and that ol' North Wind begins to blow
Keep your head together and call my name out loud, soon you'll hear me knockin' at your door.
    	Refrain
Hey ain't it good to know that you've got a friend, when people can be so cold?
They'll hurt you and desert you, they'll take your soul if you let them, ah, but don't you let them.
　　　　Refrain

YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME
You've got a friend in me, you've got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead, and you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed
Just remember what your old pal said, for you've got a friend in me,
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

You've got a friend in me, you've got a friend in me,
You got troubles, I got 'em too, there isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
If we stick together, we can see it through, 'cause you've got a friend in me
Yeah, you've got a friend in me, yeah,
	Some other folks might be a little smarter than I am, big and stronger too, maybe
	But none of them would ever love you the way I do, it's me and you, boy
And, as the years go by, our friendship will never die
You're going to see it's our destiny, you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me, yeah, you've got a friend in me

YOU'VE GOT TO HIDE YOUR LOVE AWAY
Here I stand, head in hand, turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on, feeling two-foot small

Everywhere people stare, each and every day
I can see them laugh at me, and I hear them say
     Hey! You've got to hide your love away
     Hey! You've got to hide your love away
How can I even try, I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them, in the state I'm in

How could she say to me, "Love will find a way."
Gather round, all you clowns, let me hear you say
     Hey! You've got to hide your love away
     Hey! You've got to hide your love away

YOU'VE GOT YOUR TROUBLES, I'VE GOT MINE
I see that worried look upon your face, you've got your troubles, I've got mine
She's found somebody else to take your place, you've got your troubles, I've got mine
	I too have lost my love today, all of my dreams have blown away
Now, just like you, I sit and wonder why, you've got your troubles, I've got mine
You need some sympathy, well, so do I, you've got your troubles, I've got mine
	She used to love me, that I know, and it don't seem so long ago
	That we were walking, and we were talking, the way lovers do
And so forgive me, if I seem unkind,
                                         (if I seem to you, my friend, that I ain't got no pity for you)
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
                        (well, that ain't true, you see I've lost my, lost my, lost my little girl too)
I'd help another place, another time, you've got your troubles, I've got mine

ZING A LITTLE ZONG
Zing, Zing, Zing a little Zong with me
I know we're not beside the Zuider Zee
But when you're zittin' by the zide of me,
I want to zing a little zong.
Zing zome zentimental melody
About a chapel or an apple tree
About a couple living happily
And I'll be glad to zing along
This ain't the zeason for getting' kinda zilly
You really are a dolly, a dolly and a dilly
You got a reason to cuddle kinda close to me
And we can do a very clever piece of close harmony
Oh! Zing, zing, zing it's getting late my pet

And we can zing a little love zong all night long.

ZING WENT THE STRINGS OF MY HEART
Dear, when you smiled at me, I heard a melody; It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony, zing went the strings of my heart
'Twas like a breath of Spring; I heard a robin sing, about a nest set a-part
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony, zing went the strings of my heart
Your eyes made skies seem blue again; What else could I do again?
But keep repeating through and through, "I love you, love you."
I still recall the thrill, I guess I always will, I hope 'twill never part,
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine, zing went the strings of my heart.

ZIP-A-DEE-DOO-DA
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay,  my, oh my what a wonderful day
Plenty of sunshine heading my way, Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-  ay
Mister Bluebird on my shoulder, it's the truth, it's actch'll, everything is satisfactch'll
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay, wonderful feeling, wonderful day.
