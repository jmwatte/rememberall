IF
If a picture paints a thousand words, then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show the you I've come to know.
If a face could launch a thousand ships, then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you, you're all that's left, me too
　　　　And when my love for life is running dry, you come and pour yourself on me
If a man could be two places at one time, I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way
If the world should stop revolving, spinning slowly down to die,
I'd spend the end with you, and when the world was through
            Then, one by one, the stars would all go out, then you and I would simply fly away

IF EVER I WOULD LEAVE YOU
If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer. Seeing you in summer, I never would go
Your hair streaked with sunlight, your lips red as flame,
Your face with a luster that puts gold to shame

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn. How I'd leave in autumn, I never will know
I've seen how you sparkle when fall nips the air, I know you in autumn and I must be there
	And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
	Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow
If ever I would leave you, how could it be in springtime,
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no, not in springtime, summer, winter, or fall, no never could I leave you at all

IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU
Don't know why I'm sur-viving every lonely day,
When it's got to be no chance for me, my life would end,
And it doesn't matter how I cry, my tears of love are a waste of time.
If I turn away, am I strong enough to see it through? Go crazy is what I will do.
	If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby, if I can't have you, ah ah oh.
	If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby, if I can't have you, ah ah oh.
Can't let go, and it doesn't matter how I try.
I gave it all so easily to you, my love, to dreams that never will come true.
Am I strong enough to see it through ? Go crazy is what I will do.
	If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby, if I can't have you, ah ah oh.
	If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby, if I can't have you, ah ah oh.
